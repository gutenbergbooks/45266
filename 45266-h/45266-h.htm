<h2>LIVES THAT TOUCHED.</h2>

<h3>PART II.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-w.jpg" width="127" height="135" alt="W" />
</div>

<div class="drop-capi">WHEN they reached their hotel,
they had much to say about the
brave little girl with a kind voice,
and a strong arm. Daniel the cook
knew at once by the description who
they must be. "It will be Janet
Burns, the fisherman's girl, Miss Celia; and a
nicer one never breathed. The care she takes
of them children; and the life they lead her!"
The next morning the Raymond children left
the shore, and went back to their city home.
And they were sorry, for they wanted to see
more of Janet. Weeks passed, and the business
of Christmas time came again to the Raymonds.
The box which the children were always allowed
to send to whom they would, was being planned.</div>

<p>"We would like to send it to the fisherman's
children down the coast; Janet, you know, and
all her children; Daniel told us all about them."
This was the verdict of both Celia and Annie,
and to it they clung, in the face of all objections
in the shape of not knowing what they
needed, or how they would receive a gift.
"They need everything, mamma; if you had
seen them, you would know. And of course
they will like it; who wouldn't like to have a
Christmas box?" So the box went its way.</p>

<p>It was delayed, as boxes are apt to be, so it
was Christmas morning when it reached the desolate
little home where Janet lived. It was very
desolate that day; and Janet who did not often
lose her courage, had given up and cried. No
work, and hungry mouths and worn-out clothes.
That was the whole sad story. Positively,
Christmas day as it was, there was not a mouthful
in that house to eat! They had had some
breakfast, but where the dinner was to come from
none of them knew. The father, after sitting
with his head leaning on his hands for awhile,
had risen up very slowly as though he had grown
old in a few hours, and said: "If worse comes
to worst I can go to Daniel at the hotel and ask
him for some cold pieces; but I do hate to beg."</p>

<p>Then he went out, to take one more look
through the dreary little village in search of
work. It was then the express wagon stopped at
the door, and a great box was carried in. "Janet
Burns" was the name in heavy black letters on
the box. It was a work of time to get it open.
The hammer, axe, an old file and a big old knife
each had to be tried in turn. But at last it
was open and the treasures began to come out.</p>

<p>Oh! the wonders of that box. Two plump
fat chickens bearing in their breasts a card on
which was written: "We are cooked all ready
to be eaten; or, if you like us hot, just plump us
into the oven a few minutes, for it is a cold day
and we have come fifty miles by train."</p>

<p>A beautiful ham which had another card:
"I'm boiled, and am very good eaten cold." A
bag of potatoes which said: "We are not cooked,
but if you will wash our coats and put us in your
oven you will see how fast we will get ready for
dinner." So, through the box. There were two
pies, and a cake full of raisins, and a bag of nuts
and candies. And there was a package over
which Janet cried for joy; she had laughed about
all the rest; but this had warm flannels, and
three dresses for the baby; and two suits almost
as good as new for the little girls; and a woollen
blanket for father's bed, and could it be! Yes,
there was a new dress for herself; besides this,
there were stockings and shoes, and two flannel
sacks, and I really have not time to tell you what
else. But pinned into a corner of a pretty handkerchief
which had Janet's name on it, was a
shining bit of gold worth five dollars! Can you
imagine Mr. Burns' face when he came back with
a loaf of bread he had earned, not begged, a bit
of dried beef, and found the table set, a chicken
before his plate, flanked by a dish of potatoes in
such a hurry to be eaten every one burst through
their coats? All the talk there was during the
next hour, would make a book in itself.</p>

<p>"And you ain't no notion where they came
from?" he asked for the third or fourth time.</p>

<p>"Not the least in the world. One card says:
'From Santa Claus, to the little girl who takes
good care of her brothers and sisters;' but who
knows whether I take good care of them or not?"</p>

<p>"I suspect the Lord does," said Joseph Burns
reverently, "and He has told some of his children
to send you a Christmas box. We must thank
the Lord, and trust to Him to pay the others.
He will do it." But I cannot help thinking,
what if Janet had been cross that windy day!</p>

<div class='drop-cap'>"WHY, yes," said Grandma, with her finger
on Rollo's verse, and her eyes tender
with old memories, "I remember a story about
that verse; and it is a story which I think likely
I shall remember in Heaven."</div>

<p>"Let's hear it right away, if you please,"
Ralph said, and the others settled into quiet as
soon as possible.</p>

<p>"It wasn't so very many years ago, not more
than fifty-five," began Grandma, and then Rollo
nudged Harold, and chuckled; and Marion
looked with grave astonished eyes at a woman
who thought fifty-five years was not a long, long
time! But Grandma took no notice of them.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "it is just about fifty-five
years ago. There was a pretty little boy whom
I knew; he had yellow hair, and the bluest eyes,
and he was a dear bright little fellow. One day
he went visiting out to a nice old lady's who
lived near his father's old place. While he was
there, who should come along but two trim little
girls who were out getting signers to the
Total Abstinence Pledge. We called it the
tetotal pledge in those days. There was quite
an excitement about it in town. A man lectured
every evening, and had meetings for the
children afternoons, and gave them each pledge
books, and the one who got the greatest number
of signers was to have a medal with his
name on. It wasn't a gold medal, but it shone,
and had a nice blue ribbon to put around your
neck; and the children all liked it.</p>

<p>"Well, these two came to aunt Patty's door
and asked for signers. Aunt Patty invited
them in and got out her quill pen which wasn't
used very often, and she and her oldest girl,
Prudence, put down their names. The little
fellow stood looking on; he wasn't four years
old yet, but he lived where he saw a great deal
of writing going on, and behold he wanted to
sign his name. Aunt Patty laughed, and tried
to explain to him that he was too young; but he
said No, he "writed" his name once when
"favver" held his hand, and he wanted to do it
again. That was true enough. One day his
father bought him a picture book, and guided
the pencil in his hand and let him put his name
in it. After a good deal of coaxing, aunt Patty
sat down and took him in her lap, and held that
old quill, guiding it as well as she could, and he
did get what looked something like his name in
the book. It was very queer writing," said
Grandma, stopping to laugh at the thought of it,
with that same tender look in her eyes, "but the
little fellow was just as proud of it as could be.
He told of it the first thing when he went home,
but his mother&mdash;oh! you don't know how
badly she felt."</p>

<p>"Why?" interrupted Marion and Rollo.
"Wasn't she a good mother?" asked Marion.
"Didn't she believe in temperance?" asked
Rollo.</p>

<p>"O, yes, she believed in temperance; but she
had some very strong notions about promises.
She wanted her little boy to understand all about
it whenever he made one, and then to keep it as
he would the eighth commandment; and she
said he was too young to take a pledge, that he
could not understand what it meant, and he
would think that signing his name to a paper
was a light thing, just for play. Why, children,
she felt so badly about it that she just sat
down and cried."</p>

<p>"Ho!" said Rollo, "I think she was foolish.
I dare say he understood."</p>

<p>"Go on, Grandma," said Marion.</p>

<p>"Well, while the mother was crying, the
father came home, and wanted to know all about
it; and he thought as Rollo does, that the boy
understood, or could be made to. He took him
on his knee and they had a long talk all about
drinking; what a dreadful thing it was, and
about pledges, and then what should he tell him
but this old story of the Rechabites; how they
kept the promise made to their father, never forgetting
it once; and how God was pleased, and
rewarded them. Then he made the little fellow
hold up his hand and say after him: 'Unto this
day they drink none, but obey their father's
commandment.' Then he explained that the
paper the child had signed was a promise that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
he would obey <i>his</i> father's command and never
touch liquor. 'I won't, favver,' the boy said;
'I'll 'member.' And he looked very earnest.
But in two or three minutes he was playing with
the cat; and his mother couldn't feel that he
really understood much about it.</p>

<div class="caption">THE LITTLE FELLOW LOOKED ON.</div>
</div>

<p>"It was three years afterwards, and the little
boy was seven years old&mdash;a beautiful child.
One winter his mother was very sick, every one
thought she would die; she was so low that she
didn't know her own little boy, and she couldn't
bear the least noise; so her boy was taken to
his auntie's, and stayed there for weeks. One
evening he was in the parlor with his uncle,
there were three or four gentlemen there, and
pretty soon cider was brought in. The little
boy sat beside a gentleman who offered him a
drink of cider from his glass; the boy refused
politely; and
the gentleman
thinking
he was timid,
coaxed him.
Then his uncle
spoke up:
'That young
man has
never tasted
cider, he tells
me.' At this
they all
laughed; it
was a very
unusual thing
in those days
to find a child
seven years
old who had
never tasted
cider; it
sounded almost
as
strange as it
would to say
now that one
had never
tasted water.</p>

<p>"The gentleman
said
that accounted
for his
not wanting
some; that he
did not know
how good it
was; so he
urged him to just try a swallow, and kept coaxing
until at last his uncle said, 'Try it, my boy;
if you don't like it you need not take any more.'
'No, sir,' the boy said, 'I don't want to try it!'
Well, then his uncle thought he was rude and
disobedient and ought to be made to mind; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
he said: 'I <i>command</i> you to take a swallow of it,
my boy, and I am to be obeyed, you know.'
What did that little seven-year-old baby do but
get up in the middle of the floor, with his eyes
flashing, and his cheeks glowing, and shout
out in a loud strong voice: '"Unto this day
they drink none, but obey their father's commandment,"
and I don't either. I promised, I
did; and I never will; not if you whip me to
death.' Then he burst out crying, and ran out
of the room."</p>

<p>"Good for him!" said Rollo.</p>

<p>"Oh, hurrah!" said Harold.</p>

<p>"I am <i>so</i> glad!" said Marion. "I wonder
what his mother thought then, if she ever
heard of it. Did she get well, Grandma?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she got well; and was a proud and
happy mother when she heard the story.
But that is only the beginning of it. I saw
that boy when he was a young man and
came home from college as handsome as a
picture, and I heard his father say to him:
'Well, my boy, they tell me most of the
young men use liquor more or less; how do
you get on with them?'</p>

<p>"And he looked around with his bright
laughing eyes and said:</p>

<p>"'I'm all right, father; to this day I drink
none, but obey my father's commandment.
That pledge of mine ought to be printed
in gold on my tombstone when I die, for it
has held me in the midst of many temptations.'</p>

<p>"And there his mother thought he was
too young to understand!"</p>

<p>And Grandma Burton actually wiped the
tears from her eyes, though she was smiling
yet.</p>

<p>"Grandma," said Marion, "what was that
boy's name? You haven't spoken his name
once."</p>

<p>"I guess something," said Ralph eagerly.
"Wasn't his name Mott, Grandma?"</p>

<p>"Robert Mott Burton, that was his name, my
darlings."</p>

<p>"Our own uncle Mott!" said astonished little
Sarah.</p>

<p>"Then that's what makes him such a red-hot
temperance man now, isn't it?" said Rollo.
"Didn't he begin early, though?"</p>

<h2>A CHRISTMAS STORY.</h2>

</div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">IT was Christmas morning. Gracie Bennett
had wakened early and scrambled
out of bed to take a look about her room
to see if Santa Claus had paid her a
visit while she slept. Santa Claus had queer
ways of doing things in the Bennett household.
He left packages scattered about in the most
unexpected places. He was always sure to leave
one for each member of the family in the dining-room,
to be opened at the breakfast table,
but the children did not have to wait so long
for the beginning of the day's surprises. And
Gracie found several of these before she had
taken half a dozen steps from her bed. Indeed
there was a large box on the foot of the bed. In
it she found the hat she had been longing for&mdash;just
exactly like Maud Spencer's! And there
in a smaller box was the necklace&mdash;and O, how
lovely! The bangle bracelet&mdash;mamma did
not fancy bangles and Gracie did not expect to
get that. But mamma knew that little girls'
tastes have to be cultivated considerably before
they get beyond bangles, and after talking it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
over with papa she concluded that Gracie's last
whim should be indulged since there was really
no harm in it. On went the necklace, and on
went the bracelet. "One, two, three, four, five,
six&mdash;six hooks. Let me see&mdash;cousin Tom
promised me a bangle and of course papa and
mamma will each give me one, and Maud's will
make four&mdash;O, I'll soon have enough to fill it.
My! it is shivery here," and Gracie looked
around for something to put about her; the furnace
fire had run low and it was quite cold. A
dressing-gown belonging to cousin Tom which
Louise had brought in to mend, hung over a
chair, and Gracie was soon arrayed in it. And
finding herself quite comfortable she concluded
not to go back to bed, but busied herself with
her new treasures, saying, "Just as soon as the
first bell rings I'll go and wish papa and mamma
'Merry Christmas!'" Presently the bell pealed
through the house, and Gracie, arrayed in her
new hat, made her first call. Then she pattered
down the hall to cousin Tom's room to be first
with Christmas greetings. Tom was up, and
opening the door, drew her into his room.</div>

<p>"O, how nice! your grate burns lovely."</p>

<p>After the new hat, necklace and bangle bracelet
had been duly admired, Tom and Gracie, his
little cousin, sat down in the great arm chair to
enjoy the bright fire and have one of their chats.</p>

<p>"Who are you going to make happy to-day?"</p>

<p>"Me? How can I make anybody happy?"</p>

<p>Tom smiled as he replied, "Do you not know
that you make us all happy, just by being here?"</p>

<p>"O, I thought you meant something different."</p>

<p>"So I did, little one. There are a great many
people in this city who have very little to make
them happy, and you and I who have so much
may make at least one heart joyful on this glad
Christmas day, do you not think so?"</p>

<p>"If I knew how," said Gracie.</p>

<p>"We will try to find a way. I see you are
quite dressed up this morning," referring to the
dressing-gown. "Do you see my new one?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you are the one that is dressed up."</p>

<p>"I know a poor invalid to whom I mean to
give the old one, and there is a little girl who has
not a comfortable dress nor a pair of shoes."</p>

<p>"Nor any nice hat and bracelet?"</p>

<p>"No, I doubt if she has any hat or even a hood.
I saw her out with an old shawl over her head."</p>

<p>Just then the second bell rang and Gracie was
obliged to go and get ready for breakfast. Other
surprises awaited her, but she was unusually
thoughtful, and at last Louise said, "Gracie, what
makes you so sober? Are you not satisfied?"</p>

<p>"O, yes; but I am thinking what I can give
to a little girl who has nothing to make her
happy to-day."</p>

<p>"I don't believe there are any such people,"
said Louise; "everybody manages to get about so
much out of something, I guess. They may not
have just what we have, but there's something."</p>

<p>"Do you believe that?" asked cousin Tom.</p>

<p>"Maybe not exactly, but there's no use in
making a child like Gracie miserable over what
she can't help," replied Louise, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"But she can help a little."</p>

<p>"I am going to help," said Gracie earnestly,
having caught the drift of Tom's question. "I
have made up my mind what I shall send the
little girl cousin Tom told me about."</p>

<p>"Suppose I should take you to see her?"</p>

<p>"I should like that! If mamma will let me go."</p>

<p>"I think she will. Auntie, will you let me
have Gracie for an hour this morning? I will
take good care of her."</p>

<p>"O, mamma!" expostulated Louise, "he is
going to take her among his poor people! She
will be sure to get a fever or something!"</p>

<p>"I am going to take you, too," said Tom;
"and I am not going to take either of you into
any dangerous places."</p>

<p>Louise arched her eyebrows as she replied,
"Going to take me! We'll see." But she went.
She generally did whatever Tom suggested.</p>

<p>I am not certain whether it was the package
of warm clothing, the basket containing the
Christmas dinner, the toys which Gracie had
packed, not forgetting a bead necklace, or the
presence of the beautiful child and lovely young
lady in that home, that brought the most of
happiness upon that Christmas day to the sad
heart of Karl Ritter and his lonely little girl.
But this I do know, that the visitors carried
away as much happiness as they brought, for
Gracie declared it was the nicest Christmas she
had ever spent, and even Louise confessed that
there was a new joy in her heart that day, for
she had tested the truth, "It is more blessed to
give than to receive."</p>

<h2>GEORGIE AND JACK.</h2>

<div class='poem'><div class='drop-cap'>
A SHIP lay becalmed on the ocean&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of all beautiful, helpless things!</span><br />
She lay like a wounded sea-bird<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With motionless, snow-white wings.</span><br />
Day after day had she lain there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With never a sail in sight;</span><br />
A cloudless sky above her<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Morning and noon and night.</span><br />
<br />
Precious and rare was the cargo<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hidden deep in her hold,</span><br />
To be borne to a Northern market<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And changed into yellow gold.</span><br />
But naught was that to the captain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Pacing the hot deck there,</span><br />
To the little wife who was with him,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the child with his sunny hair,</span><br />
<br />
The child who under the awning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lay moaning his life away,</span><br />
The child who was going to leave him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ere the close of that weary day.</span><br />
There was another on that good ship<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose race was nearly run,</span><br />
A bronzed and grizzled sailor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who would die ere the set of sun.</span><br />
<br />
And they two had loved each other&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sailor old and gray,</span><br />
And dear little baby Georgie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose life was a summer day.</span><br />
Was it only a childish fancy&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or because he was worn and sad</span><br />
That the sinful, weary pilgrim<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Had been loved by the little lad?</span><br />
<br />
A weak voice calls the captain:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Papa, won't you please come here?"</span><br />
"I am here&mdash;I am listening to you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What is it, Georgie dear?"</span><br />
"Papa, I want to see Jack,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Jack wants to see me so&mdash;</span><br />
Mamma says I am going to leave you,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I must see him before I go.</span><br />
<br />
"Jack says that he has been wicked,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But <i>I</i> have been wicked too;</span><br />
I think if God forgives me<br />
He'll forgive him too, don't you?<br />
<br />
"I taught him the prayer our Saviour said<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And my last best little hymn,</span><br />
And <i>I</i> think Jack is sorry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So I sha'n't worry for him.</span><br />
<br />
"But, papa, if they could bring him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And lay him down here by me,</span><br />
And I might keep <i>fast</i> hold of his hand,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I could take him to Heaven with me."</span><br />
They brought the grim old sailor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose life was so sad and wild,</span><br />
And laid him under the awning<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By the side of the little child.</span><br />
<br />
When the sun passed his meridian<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Little Georgie went away;</span><br />
The old man lived till round and red<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He dipped at the close of day.</span><br />
But ere he went his faltering tongue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This prayer sent up from the sea:</span><br />
"For Georgie's sake&mdash;for the sake of Thy Son,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Be merciful to me!"</span><br />
<br />
They treasured the small white body<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With its quiet little feet,</span><br />
But they gave to the brown old sailor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A sailor's winding-sheet.</span><br />
There came at length a blessed breeze<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That filled the limp white sail</span><br />
And tightened the creaking halyards<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With the strength of a fair fresh gale.</span><br />
<br />
So it came to pass as all things do,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That one fair and sunny day,</span><br />
Proud and staunch in the harbor<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The ship at her anchor lay.</span><br />
But the captain bent to the sad white face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That rested against his arm,</span><br />
And said, "Dear wife, little Georgie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is safe from all sin and harm;</span><br />
<br />
"His life was bright and beautiful,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With nothing its joy to dim,</span><br />
He gladdened the heart of a sinful man,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And&mdash;'took him to Heaven with him.'</span><br />
"We will bury his dust, little mother,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under the trees at home,</span><br />
But Georgie beholds the face of Him<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who said: 'Let the children come.'"</span><br />

</div>
<div class="drop-capi">NEXT thing we want to do is to earn
some money."</div>

<p>This, Jerry said, as he sat on the side
step with Nettie, after sunset. They
had been having a long talk, planning the campaign
against the enemy, which they had made
up their minds should be carried on with vigor.
At least, they had been trying to plan; but that
obstacle which seems to delight to step into the
midst of so many plans and overturn them, viz.
money, met them at every point. So when Jerry
made that emphatic announcement, Nettie was
prepared to agree with him fully; but none the
less did she turn anxious eyes on him as she
said:</p>

<p>"How can we?"</p>

<p>"I don't know yet," Jerry said, whistling a
few bars of</p>

<p>
Oh, do not be discouraged,<br />
</p>

<p>and stopping in the middle of the line to answer,
"But of course there is a way. There was an
old man who worked for my father, who used to
say so often: 'Where there's a will there's a
way,' that after awhile we boys got to calling
him 'Will and Way' for short, you know; his
name was John," and here Jerry stopped to laugh
a little over that method of shortening a name;
"but it was wonderful to see how true it proved;
he would make out to do the most surprising
things that even my father thought sometimes
could not be done. We must <i>make</i> a way to
earn some money."</p>

<p>Nettie laughed a little. "Well, I am sure,"
she said, "there is a will in this case; in fact,
there are two wills; for you seem to have a large
one, and I know if ever I was determined to do
a thing I am now; but for all that I can't think
of a possible way to earn a cent."</p>

<p>Now Sarah Ann Smith was at this moment
standing by the kitchen window, looking out on
the two schemers. Her sleeves were rolled
above her elbow, for she was about to set the
sponge for bread; she had her large neat work
apron tied over her neat dress-up calico; and on
her head was perched the frame out of which,
with Nettie's skilful help, and some pieces of
lace from her mother's old treasure bag, she
meant to make herself a bonnet every bit as
pretty as the one worn by Miss Sherrill the Sabbath
before.</p>

<p>"Talk of keeping things seven years and
they'll come good," said Mrs. Smith, watching
with satisfaction while Nettie tumbled over the
contents of the bag in eager haste and exclaimed
over this and that piece which would be "just
lovely." "I've kept the rubbish in that bag going
on to twenty years, just because the pretty
girls where I used to do clear-starching, gave
them to me. I had no kind of notion what I
should ever do with them; but they looked
bright and pretty, and I always was a master
hand for bright colors, and so whenever they
would hand out a bit of ribbon or lace, and say,
'Cerinthy, do you want that?' I was sure to say
I did; and chuck it into this bag; and now to
think after keeping of them for more than twenty
years, my girl should be planning to make a bonnet
out of them! Things is queer! I don't
ever mean to throw away <i>anything</i>. I never
was much at throwing away; now that's a
fact."</p>

<p>Now the truth was that Sarah Ann, left to
herself, would as soon have thought of making
a <i>house</i> out of the contents of that bag, as a bonnet;
but Nettie Decker's deft fingers had a natural
tact for all cunning contrivances in lace and
silk, and her skill in copying what she saw, was
something before which Sarah Ann stood in silent
admiration; when, therefore, she offered to construct
for Sarah Ann, out of the treasures of
that bag, a bonnet which should be both becoming
and economical, Sarah Ann's gratitude knew
no bounds. She went that very afternoon to the
milliner's to select her frame, and had it perched
at that moment as I said, on her head, while she
listened to the clear young voices under the window.
She had a great desire to be helpful; but
money was far from plenty at Job Smith's.</p>

<p>What was it which made her at that moment
think of a bit of news which she had heard while
at the milliner's? Why, nothing more remarkable
than that the color of Nettie Decker's hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in the fading light was just the same as Mantie
Horton's. But what made her suddenly speak
her bit of news, interrupting the young planners?
Ah, that Sarah Ann does not know; she only
knows she felt just like saying it, so she said it.</p>

<p>"Mantie Horton's folks are all going to move
to the city; they are selling off lots of things; I
saw her this afternoon when I was at the milliner's,
and she says about the only thing now
that they don't know what to do with is her old
hen and chickens; a nice lot of chicks as ever
she saw, but of course they can't take them to
the city. My! I should think they would feel
dreadful lonesome without chickens, nor pigs,
nor nothing! <i>We</i> might have some chickens as
well as not, if we only had a place to keep 'em;
enough scrapings come from the table every day,
to feed 'em, most."</p>

<p>Before this sentence was concluded, Jerry had
turned and given Nettie a sudden look as if to
ask if she saw what he did; then he whistled a
low strain which had in it a note of triumph;
and the moment Sarah Ann paused for breath
he asked: "Where do the Hortons live?"</p>

<p>"Why, out on the pike about a mile; that
nice white house set back from the road a piece;
don't you know? It is just a pleasant walk out
there."</p>

<p>Then Sarah Ann turned away to attend to her
bread, and as she did so her somewhat homely
face was lighted by a smile; for an idea had
just dawned upon her, and she chuckled over it:
"I shouldn't wonder if those young things would
go into business; he's got contrivance enough to
make a coop, any day, and mother would let
them have the scrapings, and welcome."</p>

<p>Sarah Ann was right; though Nettie, unused
to country ways and plans, did not think of such
a thing, Jerry did. The next morning he was
up, even before the sun; in fact that luminary
peeped at him just as he was turning into the
long carriage drive which led finally to the Horton
barnyard. There a beautiful sight met his
eyes; a white and yellow topknot mother, and
eight or ten fluffy chickens scampering about her.
"They are nice and plump," said Jerry to himself;
"I'm afraid I haven't money enough to buy
them; but then, there is a great deal of risk in
raising a brood of chickens like these; perhaps
he will sell them cheap."</p>

<p>Farmer Horton was an early riser, and was
busy about his stables when Jerry reached there.
He was anxious to get rid of all his live stock,
and be away as soon as possible, and here was a
customer anxious to buy; so in much less time
than Jerry had supposed it would take, the hen
and chickens changed owners and much whistling
was done by the new owner as he walked
rapidly back to town to build a house for his
family.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith had been taken into confidence;
so indeed had Job, before the purchase was made;
but the whole thing was to be a profound surprise
to Nettie. Therefore, she saw little of him
that day, and I will not deny was a trifle hurt
because he kept himself so busy about something
which he did not share with her. But I want
you to imagine, if you can, her surprise the next
morning when just as she was ready to set the
potatoes to frying, she heard Jerry's eager voice
calling her to come and see his house.</p>

<p>"See what?" asked Nettie, appearing in the
doorway, coffee pot in hand.</p>

<p>"A new house. I built it yesterday, and
rented it; the family moved in last night. That
is the reason I was so busy. I had to go
out and help move them; and I must say they
were as ill-behaved a set as I ever had anything
to do with. The mother is the crossest party I
ever saw; and she has no government whatever;
her children scurry around just where they
please."</p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" said astonished
Nettie, her face growing more and more
bewildered as he continued his merry description.</p>

<p>"Come out and see. It is a new house, I tell
you; I built it yesterday; that is the reason I
did not come to help you about the bonnet.
Didn't you miss me? Sarah Ann thinks it is
actually nicer than the one Miss Sherrill wore."
And he broke into a merry laugh, checking himself
to urge Nettie once more to come out and
see his treasures.</p>

<p>"Well," said Nettie, "wait until I cover the
potatoes, and set the teakettle off." This done
she went in haste and eagerness to discover what
was taking place behind Job Smith's barn. A
hen and chickens! Beautiful little yellow darlings,
racing about as though they were crazy;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
and a speckled mother clucking after them in a
dignified way, pretending to have authority over
them, when one could see at a glance that they
did exactly as they pleased.</p>

<p>Then came a storm of questions. "Where?
and When? and Why?"</p>

<p>"It is a stock company concern," exclaimed
Jerry, his merry eyes dancing with pleasure.
Nettie was fully as astonished and pleased as he
had hoped. "Don't you know I told you yesterday
we must plan a way to earn money? This
is one way, planned for us. <i>We</i> own Mrs.
Biddy; every feather on her knot, of which she
is so proud, belongs to us, and she must not only
earn her own living and that of her children, but
bring us in a nice profit besides. Those are
plump little fellows; I can imagine them making
lovely pot pies for some one who is willing to
pay a good price for them. Cannot you?"</p>

<p>"Poor little chickens," said Nettie in such a
mournful tone that Jerry went off into shouts of
laughter. He was a humane boy, but he could
not help thinking it very funny that anybody
should sigh over the thought of a chicken pot
pie.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;">
<img src="images/illus25.jpg" width="550" height="312" alt="flowers with faces" />
<div class="caption">"NANNIE FOUND THEM," SHE EXPLAINED.</div>
</div>

<p>"Oh, I know they are to eat," Nettie said,
smiling in answer to his laughter, "and I know
how to make nice crust for pot pie; but for all
that, I cannot help feeling sort of sorry for the
pretty fluffy chickens. Are you going to fat
them all, to eat; or raise some of them to lay
eggs?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what <i>we</i> are going to do, yet,"
Jerry said with pointed emphasis on the we.
"You see, we have not had time to consult; this
is a company concern, I told you. What do you
think about it?"</p>

<p>Nettie's cheeks began to grow a deep pink;
she looked down at the hurrying chickens with
a grave face for a moment, then said gently:
"You know, Jerry, I haven't any money to help
buy the chickens, and I cannot help own what I
do not help buy; they are your chickens, but I
shall like to watch them and help you plan about
them."</p>

<p>Jerry sat down on an old nail keg, crossed
one foot over the other, and clasped his hands
over his knees, as Job Smith was fond of doing,
and prepared for argument:</p>

<p>"Now, see here, Nettie Decker, let us understand
each other once for all; I thought we had
gone into partnership in this whole business;
that we were to fight that old fiend Rum, in
every possible way we could; and were to help
each other plan, and work all the time, and in all
ways we possibly could. Now if you are tired
of me and want to work alone, why, I mustn't
force myself upon you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>
<p>"O, Jerry!" came in a reproachful murmur
from Nettie, whose cheeks were now flaming.</p>

<p>"Well, what is a fellow to do? You see you
hurt my feelings worse than old Mother Topknot
did this morning when she pecked me; I want
to belong, and I mean to; but all that kind of
talk about helping to buy these half-dozen little
puff-balls is all nonsense, and a girl of your
sense ought to be ashamed of
it."</p>

<p>Said Nettie, "O, Jerry, I
smell the potatoes; they are
scorching!" and she ran away.
Jerry looked after her a
moment, as though astonished
at the sudden change of subject,
then laughed, and rising
slowly from the nail-keg addressed
himself to the hen.</p>

<p>"Now, Mother Topknot, I
want you to understand that
you belong to the firm; that
little woman who was just here
is your mistress, and if you
peck her and scratch her as you
did me, this morning, it will be
the worse for you. You are
just like some people I have
seen; haven't sense enough to
know who is your best friend;
why, there is no end to the nice
little bits she will contrive for
you and your children, if you
behave yourself; for that matter,
I suspect she would do it
whether you behaved yourself
or not; but that part it is quite
as well you should not understand.
I want you to bring
these children up to take care
of themselves, just as soon as
you can; and then you are to
give your attention to laying a nice fresh egg
every morning; and the sooner you begin, the
better we shall like it." Then he went in to
breakfast.</p>

<p>There was no need to say anything more
about the partnership. Nettie seemed to come
to the conclusion that she must be ashamed
of herself or her pride in the matter; and after
a very short time grew accustomed to hearing
Jerry talk about "Our chicks," and dropped
into the fashion of caring for and planning about
them. None the less was she resolved to find
some way of earning a little money for her share
of the stock company. Curiously enough it was
Susie and little Sate who helped again. They
came in one morning, with their hands full of the
lovely field daisies. The moment Nettie looked
at the two little faces, she knew that a dispute
of some sort was in progress. Susie's lips were
curved with that air of superior wisdom, not to
say scorn, which she knew how to assume; and
little Sate's eyes were full of the half-grieved but
wholly positive look which they could wear on
occasion.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 336px;">
<img src="images/illus28.jpg" width="336" height="450" alt="woman looking out window" />
<div class="caption">SARAH ANN.</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>"What is it?" Nettie asked, stopping on her
way to the cellar with a nice little pat of butter
which she was saving for her father's supper.
Butter was a luxury which she had decided the
children at least, herself included, must not expect
every day.</p>

<p>"Why," said Susie, her eyes flashing her contempt
of the whole thing, "she says these are
folks; old women with caps, and eyes, and
noses, and everything; she says they look at
her, and some of them are pleasant, and some
are cross. She is too silly for anything. They
don't look the least bit in the world like old
women. I told her so, fifty-eleven times, and
she keeps saying it!"</p>

<p>Nettie held out her hand for the bunch of
daisies and looked at them carefully, and
laughed.</p>

<p>"Can't you see them?" was little Sate's eager
question. "They are just as plain! Don't you
see them a little bit of a speck, Nannie?"</p>

<p>"Of course she doesn't!" said scornful Susie.
"Nobody but a silly baby like you would think
of such a thing."</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Nettie, still smiling, "I
don't think I see them as plain as Sate does, but
maybe we can, after awhile; wait till I get my
butter put away, and I'll put on my spectacles
and see what I can find."</p>

<p>So the two waited, Susie incredulous and disgusted,
Sate with a hopeful light in her eyes,
which made Nettie very anxious to find the old
ladies. On her way up stairs she felt in her
pocket for the pencil Jerry had sharpened with
such care the evening before; yes, it was there,
and the point was safe. Jerry had made a neat
little tube of soft wood for it to slip into, and
so protect itself.</p>

<p>"Now, let us look for the old lady," she said,
taking a daisy in hand and retiring to the closet
window for inspection; it was the work of a
moment for her fingers which often ached for
such work, to fashion a pair of eyes, a nose, and
a mouth; and then to turn down the white
petals for a cap border, leaving two under the
chin for strings!</p>

<p>"Does your old lady look anything like that?"
she questioned, as she came out from her hiding
place. Little Sate looked, and clasped her
hands in an ecstacy of delight: "Look, Susie,
look, quick! there she is, just as plain! O
Nannie! I'm <i>so</i> glad you found her."</p>

<p>"Humph!" said Susie, "she made her with a
pencil; she wasn't there at all; and there
couldn't nobody have found her. So!"</p>

<p>And to this day, I suppose it would not be
possible to make Susie Decker believe that the
spirits of beautiful old ladies hid in the daisies!
Some people cannot see things, you know, show
them as much as you may.</p>

<p>But Nettie was charmed with the little old
woman. She left the potatoes waiting to be
washed, and sat down on the steps with eager
little Sate, and made old lady after old lady.
Some with spectacles, and some without. Some
with smooth hair drawn quietly back from quiet
foreheads, some with the old-fashioned puffs and
curls which she had seen in old, old pictures of
"truly" grandmothers. What fun they had!
The potatoes came near being forgotten entirely.
It was the faithful old clock in Mrs. Smith's
kitchen which finally clanged out the hour and
made Nettie rise in haste, scattering old ladies
right and left. But little Sate gathered them,
every one, holding them with as careful hand as
though she feared a rough touch would really
hurt their feelings, and went out to hunt Susie
and soothe her ruffled dignity. She did not find
Susie; that young woman was helping Jerry nail
laths on the chicken coop; but she found her
sweet-faced Sabbath-school teacher, who was
sure to stop and kiss the child, whenever she
passed. To her, Sate at once showed the sweet
old women. "Nannie found them," she explained;
"Susie could not see them at all, and
she kept saying they were not there; but Nannie
said she would make them look plainer so
Susie could see, and now Susie thinks she made
them out of a pencil; but they were there, before,
I saw them."</p>

<p>"Oh, you quaint little darling!" said Miss
Sherrill, kissing her again. "And so your sister
Nettie made them plainer for you. I must
say she has done it with a skilful hand. Sate
dear, would you give one little old woman to
me? Just one; this dear old face with puffs, I
want her very much."</p>

<p>So Sate gazed at her with wistful, tender eyes,
kissed her tenderly, and let Miss Sherrill carry
her away.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>She carried her straight to the minister's
study, and laid her on the open page of a great
black commentary which he was studying.
"Did you ever see anything so cunning? That
little darling of a Sate says Nannie 'found' her;
she doesn't seem to think it was made, but simply
developed, you know, so that commoner
eyes than hers could see it; that child was born
for a poet, or an artist, I don't know which.
Tremayne, I'm going to take this down to the
flower committee, and get them to invite Nettie
to make some bouquets of dear old grandmothers,
and let little Sate come to the flower
party and sell them. Won't that be lovely?
Every gentleman there will want a bouquet of
the nice old ladies in caps, and spectacles; we
will make it the fashion; then they will sell
beautifully, and the little merchant shall go
shares on the proceeds, for the sake of her artist
sister."</p>

<p>"It is a good idea," said the minister. "I infer
from what that handsome boy Jerry has
told me, that they have some scheme on hand
which requires money. I am very much interested
in those young people, my dear. I wish
you would keep a watch on them, and lend a
helping hand when you can."</p>

<h2>NEVER GIVE UP.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>WILLIAM J. was the son of a very poor
man. He was born near sawmills and
shipyards. His home was humble, but piety and
industry were seen there. William made up his
mind that he would have an education. His
motto was, "No such word as fail." He did not
have the chances that you have in these good
days. No, indeed, to get an education meant to
him hard work, <i>hard work</i>! When working in
the shipyard he often had a book open before
him, and thus every golden moment was improved.
What do you think he used at night,
in the winter, for his lamp? Can you guess?
A <i>pine knot</i>! And in summer his lamp was the
light of the moon. Once he rode thirty miles to
attend a spelling match.</div>

<p>When sixteen he opened a little school, and
the next thing was to study Latin and Greek.
The boy had set his heart on college, and it almost
looks as though a boy can accomplish anything
with such a motto as poor William's.
He borrowed some Latin and Greek books, and
set hard to work. Soon his dear parents died,
and so the care of a brother and sister fell upon
him. On entering college he found that he had
worked too hard&mdash;for his eyes so failed that he
had to leave off study and wear a green shade,
but still he would not give up. He got his room-mate
to <i>read to him</i>. He not only pushed
through college himself, but helped his brother
through also. Amid all these difficulties he
graduated with high honors, became a professor
in the same college, and was ever found in the
path of duty and rectitude. Remember William,
my little ones, and resolve on some plan of
life, and pursue it with all your heart and soul.</p>

<h2>ARTHUR IN THE MUSEUM.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-m.jpg" width="77" height="93" alt="M" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi">MR. ESSEX and his son Arthur had
spent an hour riding through the park.
For a change, they entered the museum
to see the curiosities there. Arthur
preferred the great hall where the animals were
confined in their iron cages. He never tired of
gazing at the glaring eyes of the tiger, and
watching his tread round and round his prison,
as if to find some way out. Now and then he
would utter a terrible growl that would make
Arthur tremble. Near by lay asleep "the king
of the forest," as the lion is called. And a little
farther yet was the monkey department.</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 338px;">
<img src="images/illus35.jpg" width="338" height="333" alt="donkey's head" />
<div class="caption">THE STUFFED DONKEY.</div>
</div>

<p>Once there, laughing at their funny pranks,
Arthur cared not to go a step further or see anything
else. Suddenly looking around he exclaimed,
"Father, do see that queer chap up
there, making faces and shaking his head at
some of us. I wonder what he would do if he
could get at us."</p>

<p>"Scratch your eyes out, maybe," said a
strange voice.</p>

<p>Arthur started at the unaccustomed tones
and searched anxiously the many faces for his
father's, but it was not among them. Where
was he? Was Arthur alone? Had his father
left him in such a place?</p>

<p>He pressed his way out of the throng,
hurried this way and that, wondering what he
should do, when to his great joy there sat his
father looking up at a donkey that stood in a high
place calmly contemplating the people below.</p>

<p>"Why, father," broke out Arthur, "I feared
I or you was lost. But what are you doing in
this spot, looking at that stupid beast? Did you
never see a donkey before?"</p>

<p>"Not such a donkey," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Umph! what's a donkey pray, but&mdash;a
donkey? Stubborn, ugly thing. Come and see
the monkeys and enjoy yourself. All the people
are there. They are cutting up enough to
make you laugh yourself to pieces."</p>

<p>"And yet, my boy, there is more in that dead,
stuffed donkey to interest your father than all
the rest of this museum and every monkey in
Africa to boot. You see the donkey has not a
very beautiful face, neither is his motion the
most rapid or graceful, and sometimes he is a
bit stubborn, though that is because he is cruelly
treated, yet the world of business could get on
quite well without tigers and monkeys; not so
well without donkeys. They are not for show,
but for work, like some plain folks whose hands
are rough doing other people good."</p>

<p>"But what about this donkey? I never saw
one in a museum before."</p>

<p>"And you may never again. This one wrote
his own history, and he did it in five minutes,
and with his heels!"</p>

<p>"How in the world was that?" asked Arthur.</p>

<p>"That donkey, I am told, was at work in the
park. A lion broke from his cage. He was
hungry. He saw the donkey as he went leaping
through the grounds and sprang upon him.
A terrible fight followed. The donkey had
neither teeth nor claws like the lion to defend
himself. He could not get away. But God had
given him great strength&mdash;so, with a mighty
effort, he shook off his enemy and quickly turning,
dealt him rapid and strong kicks, planting
his blows between the eyes of the lion and
tumbling him into an abyss, where the stunned
beast died from his wounds. The brave donkey,
however, was so dreadfully cut here and there
by the lion's teeth that he soon bled to death.</p>

<p>"The battle was witnessed by many amid
great excitement. Their sympathy was all with
the donkey who was only doing what every one
should do when attacked by a bloodthirsty foe&mdash;defend
themselves.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Such was the admiration for this beast which
you call ugly and stubborn, that as soon as he
died, a taxidermist who makes it his business to
preserve the skins of animals and give them a
life-like look, took this donkey in charge and
there you see him.</p>

<p>"Here I've been sitting for one long hour looking
at this stuffed beast. And I've been wondering
how many of all that crowd over there by
the monkeys would do and die if necessary for
some noble cause. Would you, my boy?" said
Mr. Essex, giving Arthur a searching look.</p>

<p>"God helping me," he answered, "I'll try to
be right and true everywhere and every time.
I should be ashamed to be outdone by a donkey."</p>

<h2>MANUFACTURE OF SILVER SPOONS.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>PROBABLY there is no article of table or of
other household use in the production of
which so little of machine working is employed.
Almost all the work on solid silver spoons is
hand work; the exceptions are the rolling of the
ingot into plates, and the production of spoons
with ornamentation in relief, which is produced
by recessed patterns on the rolls.</div>

<p>The material for spoons is coin silver obtained
from the Government mints in ingots, or
from trade for old silver, or from the use of current
coin. This is melted over a charcoal fire in
plumbago crucibles to a certain heat, known to
the adept by the appearance of the surface of the
molten metal; it is poured into castiron moulds,
forming bars of about seventy ounces each.</p>

<p>These bars are heated over a forge fire of
charcoal and worked on the anvil by hammer
and sledge, precisely as iron or steel is worked,
or are rolled into plates or ribbons. Occasional
annealings are necessary to prevent cracking.</p>

<p>The ribbon for the ordinary teaspoon is four
and a half inches long by three eighths of an inch
wide. When rolled, a blank of two and a quarter
inches is lengthened to four and a half inches,
to thin it down to spoon thickness. Before rolling
or hammering, silver is very nearly as soft
as lead; but with these mechanical processes it
can be made hard and rigid. Good springs can
be made of silver hammered or rolled.</p>

<p>To form the bowl of the teaspoon, the bar, of
three eighths of an inch wide and less than three
thirty-seconds of an inch thick, is hammered flat
on an anvil with a crowning face until the workman
has spread it into an oval, which is much
thinner in the middle than at the edges, as the
edges are to receive the bulk of the wear. The
handles are formed also by the hammer.</p>

<p>The curvature of the bowl is produced by repeated
"coaxing" blows by a steel punch and a
die of cast composition of lead and tin. No file
dressing is employed on the faces of the spoon;
only the edges are file-dressed to form. From
the anvil and the die the spoons come to hand-smoothing
with Scotch gray stones and polishing
by stiff brushes, generally revolving brushes
charged with "grits" and oil. Burnishing is
the finish of spoons as of all bright silver goods.</p>

<h2>OUR ALPHABET OF GREAT MEN.</h2>

<h3>L.&mdash;LINCOLN, ABRAHAM.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-o.jpg" width="57" height="112" alt="O" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">OF course; who should it be if not our
Lincoln? The name is a household
word in all our homes, and I doubt if
I can tell you anything which you do
not already know about this great man;
the story of his life and his deeds are familiar to
every schoolboy. His features are well known
to you all, for there is scarcely a home that has
not his portrait upon its walls.</div>

<p>In 1809 Abraham Lincoln was born in
a lonely cabin on the banks of a small river
or creek in Kentucky; born to poverty,
hardship and obscurity, born to rise from
obscurity, through poverty, hardship and
toil to the highest point of an American
boy's ambition. He early learned the
meaning of privation and self-denial. The
accounts of his early life are somewhat
meagre, but he has told us himself that
he had only about one year of school-life.
Think of that, you boys who are going
steadily forward year after year, from the
primary school through all the intermediate
grades up to the advanced, then
to the academy, thence to college, and
afterwards to law and divinity schools,
think of Abraham Lincoln's school privileges
and be thankful for your own. And
more, show your appreciation by your improvement
of your advantages.</p>

<p>Like many of our great men, Lincoln was
what we style a self-made man, and yet it
seems that he owed something of his
making to his stepmother. His own
mother died when he was a small boy, and
the new mother who sometime after came into
the family was very helpful to the boy, encouraging
him in his love of books, and under
her guidance he became a great reader, devouring
every book he could lay his hands
upon. Did it ever occur to you that it might
be an advantage to some of us if we had fewer
books? Driven back again and again to the
few, we should read them more carefully and
make the thoughts our own, and perhaps the
stock of ideas gathered from books would even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
exceed that which we gain from the multitude
of books we have in these days of bookmaking.
Whether you read much or little, few books or
many, boys, read with careful thought. Take
in and digest thoroughly the thoughts presented
to you.</p>

<p>Well, this young man had but few books, but
he seems to have laid by a number of ideas
which should develop in time into acts which
were to startle the world and overthrow existing
institutions. He worked through his boyhood
and early manhood with his hands, sometimes
on a farm, sometimes as a clerk in a country
store. Now as a boatman, now at clearing
up and fencing a farm.</p>

<div class="caption">LINCOLN'S EARLY HOME IN KENTUCKY.</div>
</div>

<p>It was while engaged in this last-mentioned
employment that he earned the title afterwards
given him in derision by his political opponents,
"The rail splitter," but I suspect that he could
have answered as did the boy who in the days
of prosperity was taunted with having been a
bootblack, "Didn't I do it well?"</p>

<div class="caption">LINCOLN'S FIRST HOUSE IN ILLINOIS.</div>
</div>
<p>At length the way opened&mdash;or, as I think, he
by his exertions forced a way to study law, and
he began his practice of the profession in Springfield,
Ill.</p>

<p>I ought to have told you, however, that before
his admission to the bar he served in the
Black Hawk War as captain of a company of
volunteers. He soon gained distinction as a
lawyer, but presently became interested in politics.</p>

<p>And from that time his history is closely
identified with that of his country. To tell you
of the leading incidents even of his career would
be to give you in a nutshell the history of the
United States for that period. His noted contest
with Stephen A. Douglas, his election to the
presidency, his re-election, his celebrated Emancipation
Proclamation, all these matters belong
to the story of the stirring events of those years
of our history. Then came the sad ending of
this noble life; the cruel assassination of the
beloved President, and the great man of the
time.</p>

<p>Boys, you who have studied his character,
will you tell me what made Abraham Lincoln
great?</p>

<h2>MY BRAINLESS ACQUAINTANCE.</h2>

<h3>III.&mdash;A STRANGE HISTORY.</h3>

<div class='center'><span class="smcap">BY Paranete.</span></div>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">I WAS born, as you might say," began the
pin, "in two different places, which I
suppose you must think is very queer,
but I assure you it is true. You see I
am composed of two different kinds of metal,
and one kind came from the State of Minnesota,
in this country, and the other from the country
of Wales, in the British Isles. The first kind is
copper, and the second is zinc. Also, if you ask
your mother what I am made of, she will say
brass. I will tell you about my early history.
My first part was born deep down in the earth,
in Minnesota. One day the stone I was in heard
a great pounding, and soon it was brought to
light. It was piled into a car, with many other
stones of its kind, and was taken a long way off
where the car dumped it into a hole; then great
hammers came down and crushed it, with others,
into little bits of pieces. Then it was taken out,
burned, put in a lot of liquids about which I do
not know, till it came out a beautiful shining
sheet of copper; that's all I know of my first part.</div>

<p>"As for my second part, that came from way
down in the earth too, in the form of a black
stone. Then it was, like the copper ore, carried
off and dumped, and great rollers came and
crushed it as small as those nuts that you like
so much&mdash;I don't know their name.</p>

<p>"From there, the little stones were all shoveled
into big pots, and roasted for a very long
while until they turned into liquid and dropped in
little drops down into great pans. From there
they were put into other pots, where they were
again melted and stirred and skimmed, just as
your mother treats her milk. Then the liquid
was poured into great holes that cooled it off,
and it came out one great beautiful cake of zinc.
That is all that there is about my second part.</p>

<p>"The two large sheets were then both sent in
a train to a large manufactory, and the zinc was
put in a furnace, where it was entirely melted,
and then the sheet of copper (twice as big as
that of zinc) was broken up and mixed in, where
it also melted. After this was roasted a good
deal, it was poured into moulds which made it
into good-sized plates, and it was called brass.
So my first and second parts were united, and I
was neither copper nor zinc, but brass.</p>

<p>"The sheet of brass out of which I came was
packed with many others, and sent to another
large building, where it was unpacked, and by
means that I never understood, and never expect
to, was drawn through enormous rollers,
which cut it into long, square rods. I will only
tell you of the one out of which I came.</p>

<p>"It was speedily made pointed, and a workman
passed it through a small hole, where a pair
of pincers took right hold and pulled it along;
then it was put around a sort of wheel, which
went round and round, drawing the rod through
the hole, and making it smaller and smaller all
the while, and winding it around itself. Then
the point was put through a smaller hole, and
drawn through again, until it went through
actually twenty-five holes! I counted.</p>

<p>"Every little while the rod which had become
wire then, was melted red-hot, and then doused
in cold water. I do not know what this was for.</p>

<p>"Soon the wire was quite small, of a bright
yellow color, and was coiled on wheels, and put
in large dark boxes, to take a journey. The
journey seemed long to me, though I do not
suppose it was. When we reached our destination,
several coils of wire were sent up in wagons,
to a large building in the city, where we
were unloaded, and carried in. My coil was
taken off the wheel and wound round a little reel
that stood at the end of a queer-looking machine.</p>

<p>"My part of the wire was at the very end, and
I felt myself suddenly seized by a little steel
thumb and finger, and drawn forward a little,
where an immense pair of shears suddenly cut
me off to about the length that you see me now.
Going on a little further in my journey through
the machine, I was suddenly between a pair of
rollers that mashed me all down except where
my head is, so that while I had had no head before,
I was possessed of one now. Going on
still further, I confronted a sort of a grindstone,
which rubbed my point down so speedily that
while I was wondering what it was going to do,
I found I had a point. Then my journey suddenly
ended, and I dropped into a trough where
there were many pins like myself; and now that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
I may give you an idea of the amazing velocity
with which I journeyed, I will tell you what cannot
but be true, I was not longer than ten seconds
in going from the coil of wire to the trough.</p>

<p>"You may think, my dear friend, that this
must have been very uncomfortable, and have
hurt me a great deal, but Providence is good,
and has provided for me so greatly, that I, because
I have to go through adventures that
would cost you mortals so much sufferings,
actually have no feelings at all! Therefore it
was, that while it was disagreeable, this being
pounded and jammed so much, I cannot truthfully
say that it hurt me in the least. You
must excuse that bit of moralizing.</p>

<p>"Well, from the trough we were carried off,
and put in kettles of what they called nitric
acid, with pieces of tin in it. Then we were
boiled again over a hot fire, much to my dismay,
for I thought that now I was a pin, I had got
through being boiled and roasted. But there I
was boiling again, and the tin melted and stuck
to me all over, so that I looked like silver instead
of the bright yellow that I had been before.
When we had dried sufficiently we were
all buried in a barrel of sawdust, and rolled and
rolled. This, it seems, was to make us shine
more, and when I came out, I shone like crystal.</p>

<p>"From this place we were all carried off in
barrels again, and thrown ruthlessly down where
there were some steel bars awaiting us, and we
started to drop through them, but were caught
by our heads, and the bars dropped down with us,
and we again dropped&mdash;into the holes pricked
in the green paper. All of my companions had
not been caught by the steel bars, but had
dropped below them, and I never saw them again.</p>

<p>"Now that I was a pin, all dressed up in my
coat of tin, and having a couple of holes to stick
through, I was perfectly happy, especially as I
had so many pleasant companions.</p>

<p>"The paper that I had dropped in, had a row
of black pins as well as silver-colored ones.
These informed me that when they had been
carried up to the pots to boil, Japan varnish&mdash;whatever
that may be&mdash;had been used, instead
of tin, making them black.</p>

<p>"Soon we were packed, with many others, in
a large box, taken to the depot in a wagon, and
sent off on the cars. It was very dark in the
box; but there were so many of us we had
rather lively times, after all. Still we by no
means regretted it when at last the journey was
ended and our box was opened."</p>

<h2>WATCH AND THE MINISTER.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE minister's pew was a large square one
near the pulpit and exposed to a fire of eyes.</div>

<p>Mr. Tyler, the minister, owned a large dog
named Watch, who was bent on going to church
with Mrs. Tyler. She was opposed, fearing that
he might excite the mirth of the children.</p>

<p>Every Sunday a series of manoelig;uvres took
place between the two, in which Watch often
proved himself the keenest. Sometimes he
slipped away very early; and Mrs. Tyler, after
having searched for him to shut him up, would
go to church and find Watch seated in the family
pew, looking very grave and decorous, but
evidently aware that it was too late now to turn
him out. Sometimes he would hide himself
until the family had all started for church, and
would then follow the footsteps of some tardy
worshiper who tiptoed in during prayers with
creaking boots; and then didn't Watch know
that Mrs. Tyler would open the pew door in
haste, to prevent his whining for admission?</p>

<p>When Mr. Tyler became in earnest in his appeals,
he often repeated the same word with a
ringing emphasis and a blow on the desk cushion
that startled the sleepers in the pews.</p>

<p>One day he thus shouted out, quoting the well-known
text, "Watch! watch! watch, I say!"
when bounce, came the dog almost into his arms.</p>

<p>You may be sure that the boys all took occasion
to relieve their pent-up restlessness by one
uproarious laugh, before their astonished parents
had time to frown them into silence.</p>

<p>Honest Watch had been sitting with his eye
fixed, as usual, on the minister. At the first
mention of his name, he went, his ears and his
eyes kindled; at the second, he was still more
deeply moved; at the third, he obeyed, and flew
completely over the pew rail and pulpit door,
with leaps that did equal honor to his muscular
powers and his desire to obey. After such a
strict interpretation of the letter rather than the
spirit, Watch was effectually forbidden church-going.&mdash;<i>Selected.</i></p>

<h2>ST. GEORGE AND THE DRAGON.</h2>

<h3>III.</h3>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-i.jpg" width="72" height="95" alt="I" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">IT was nothing," said George Edward
carelessly, as the family assembled
around him in excited gratitude, and
with fulsome praise, drawn thither by
queer little noises down stairs in the library,
and rattlings of window, suggestive of burglars,
"I only pulled her in. She was good,
and helped. Do stop talking of it; let's have
the stockings. It's most morning."</div>

<p>"You are a brave boy," cried Hortense's
father, uncle Gerald.</p>

<p>"You've saved her life," exclaimed Hortense's
mother.</p>

<p>Hortense disengaged herself from her parents,
and ran up to her cousin, putting her arms
around him.</p>

<p>"I wasn't good. I wouldn't go up stairs when
he told me, and I climbed up on the window-sill
to lean out and see Santa Claus coming, and
I slipped, and the window came down on my
fingers, and I rolled around on the shed and most
pulled him off."</p>

<p>"And you needn't try to hide your hand,"
said uncle Thomas, where they were visiting,
"because we all see that it is bleeding."</p>

<p>At that there was a second rush for the hero
of the hour, and the excited relatives each had
to examine for himself and herself George Edward's
thumb torn by the catch of the blind as
he pulled himself up.</p>

<p>To save him from further sympathy, his
mother seconded his proposition to have the
Christmas stockings then and there.</p>

<p>"I know it is only quarter-past two," she said
laughingly, "but these young folks won't sleep
a wink if we send them to bed, nor I fancy will
we elders do much better. Let us all go up to
our rooms, give ourselves just ten minutes to
array ourselves in something more festive and
befitting the occasion than"&mdash;</p>

<p>"These bath wrappers, mackintoshes, and
gossamer waterproofs," finished somebody in the
group for her.</p>

<p>"O, aunt Fannie, aunt Fannie, what a Christmas
frolic," cried two of the other mammas,
not waiting for her to finish.</p>

<p>"O, aunt Fannie, aunt Fannie, what fun!"
cried the young people.</p>

<p>George Edward swelled with pride at his
mother's popularity. "Come on," he cried, "see
who gets down first."</p>

<p>At that there was a regular stampede, old as
well as young taking part, uncle Thomas only
remaining to light the Christmas candles on
the mantel and in the tall candlesticks on the piano
underneath the holly and pine branches.</p>

<p>When the company assembled again in the
library it was hard to believe that it was the
same one so lately within those walls, and it was
marvelous how much in the way of adornment
could be accomplished in ten moments by one who
gave "his whole mind to it." Some of the neckties
however were tied on the way down stairs,
and even boots buttoned in the same convenient
resting-place, but these were only trifling matters
when the general dress-parade was so fine, and
nobody noticed any little discrepancy of attire
in another.</p>

<p>The children planted themselves before the
row of stockings hanging in the candlelight, and
before the fire on the hearth, now poked up to
its duty, and crackling away in all the proper
Christmas jollity. They pretended not to be excited,
but it was pretty hard work.</p>

<p>At last Bamford said, "Hortense is in a dreadful
hurry. It's too bad to keep her waiting.
Let's begin."</p>

<p>"So she should," said uncle Thomas, with a
twinkle in his eye, "have hers at once. Hurry
up, Hortie, and pull it off the nail. Bamford is
so big I suppose he's going to wait till the last."</p>

<p>Bamford glared at him, and burst out: "Indeed
I'm not. We are all children tonight."</p>

<p>"That's right, my boy," said uncle Thomas
approvingly, "only say what you mean at first,
and not get things over other people's shoulders.
Now, one, two, three, see who gets his Christmas
stocking first."</p>

<p>It carried the older part of the company back
to their young days to see the scramble that followed,
and they laughed until the tears came, to
witness the gale the children were in. It was a
Christmas frolic pure and simple, and pretty soon
every soul in the room was engaged in it; the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was a shower of comfits and bonbons scattered
in approved style after the stockings were declared
really empty, yielding nothing more from
vigorous shakings.</p>

<p>"I never was so rich in my life," cried George
Edward in a burst of gratitude, patting his pile
of presents. "It was just the jolliest stocking
my Santa Claus ever brought," and he marched
up to put his arm around his mother's neck.</p>

<p>"I don't think I got as much as I did last
year when I staid at home," remarked Fisher
slowly and examining once more his pile. It
was an awful speech to make, and it showed the
soul of the boy. But it was forgiven as a slip of
the tongue due to Christmas hilarity.</p>

<p>What a gala day! Nobody thought of being
tired till well on into the night again, and then
games and Christmas songs around aunt Ruth's
cottage piano, being over, they one and all began
to think of bed, and to speak even lovingly
of the old routine to-morrow.</p>

<p>"I shall help you shovel the snow off, uncle
Thomas, in front of the house," declared Bamford.</p>

<p>"So will I," cried George Edward, coming
out of a yawn; "oh dear, I feel full of candy to
my ears. I'd like a good pinch of salt."</p>

<p>"I'm al<i>most</i> sick of caramels," acknowledged
Effie, daintily laying one by one in her bon-bon
box to pick out a plain lemon drop. "Wouldn't
it be dreadful to have to eat them always?"</p>

<p>George Edward made a wry face. Then he
twisted his mouth up into a funny little pucker.
"Let's make a candy bag and drop it at Tim
Ryan's door to-morrow," he cried.</p>

<p>Tim Ryan was the man who took care of uncle
Thomas' furnace, and swept out his store. He
lived two blocks off in a dingy tenement house.</p>

<p>Effie closed her fingers involuntarily on her
caramel with old-time fondness.</p>

<p>"Candy isn't good for poor folks," said Bamford
sententiously, and cramming his mouth full
of taffy.</p>

<p>"They get so little, it surprises their digestive
apparatus," said uncle Thomas dryly. "I don't
believe our contributions however in that line
will harm them."</p>

<p>Hortense turned a stiff little back upon her
precious candy pile, most of it saved with provident
forethought to eat in the following days
when amusements would run low. Could she?</p>

<p>She swallowed very hard an obstacle in her
throat, said <i>no</i> in big letters to her own small
mind, then ran over to George Edward, both
hands full of sweets, and said in an odd little way
all her own: "There, that's to make the poor
people sick." A shout greeted her; but her
mother kissed her, and Hortense was satisfied.</p>

<p>The baby of the group must not shame them
all. So it was quite a respectable pile that at
last lay in a good-sized paper bag tied with a
flaming red ribbon, all ready for the expedition
to Tim Ryan's after breakfast the next morning.</p>

<p>The candy did not injure the Ryans big and
little, we will only say, but they came out of the
feast with blooming sticky faces, and hearts full
of gratitude toward the "Allen childer."</p>

<p>And then in two days they were all, that
merry company, back once more in their homes,
happy in the memory of the good time they had
had, and full of pluck and enthusiasm for school
and home life.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Jared Lewis, a
rather dull boy in No. 9, the room that held
George Edward in school-hours, broke out one
day in the reading class with a new idea before
them all. Jared was of a somewhat dull turn of
mind, I have said. Certainly not a brilliant boy.
But he held to a thought with wonderful pertinacity
that once got into his mind; nothing could
shake it.</p>

<p>They happened in the reading upon an
abridged version of the Eastern legend of St.
George and the Dragon, woven into a touching
little English tale. We all know the stirring
legend of the patron saint of England, Germany,
and Venice, and of all chivalrous soldiers in the
army battling against cruelty and injustice. It
makes the blood leap in one's veins to read or to
tell it, and one longs to grasp the good sword and
go out to fight in the great world with the noble
army of martyrs who enroll themselves on the
side of the weak and suffering. There was many
a sober little face, and one or two who pretended
the light was bad for their eyes when Jared had
stumbled through his rendition of the closing
part. But he was so full of his new idea that his
countenance was radiant and he cried in a loud
assured tone, "Why, he goes to our school&mdash;he's
here to-day."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who?" cried the teacher, and the children
thrilled too suddenly, began to titter nervously.</p>

<p>"George Edward Allen," said Jared confidently.
"He's Saint George, and he's always
fighting a Dragon. He knocked a boy down
yesterday for yanking a cat's tail."</p>

<p>The children stopped laughing, and, sharing
his enthusiasm, nodded "yes, yes," to Jared.
George Edward on the back seat studying his
geography raised his head at the commotion.
His face turned as red as fire and he made as
though he would shoot his book through the air
at the speaker's head. Jared went on in admiration
more forcible than elegant: "He's always for
the littlest dog in the fight, against the big fellows.
I'd like to know if that isn't St. George."</p>

<h2>SOME REMARKABLE WOMEN.</h2>

<h3>I.&mdash;ISABELLA I.</h3>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 269px;">
<img src="images/illus54.jpg" width="269" height="282" alt="with Isabella barely seen behind Ferdinant" />
<div class="caption">FERDINAND AND ISABELLA.</div>
</div>

<p>This remarkable
woman,
Isabella
of Spain,
lived four
hundred
years ago.
Her name
is always
associated
with that
of her husband,
Ferdinand, King of Castile and Aragon.
Isabella was a woman of
strong character and great resolution,
as well as of remarkable talent.
She married the one whom she
wished to marry in spite of the
opposition of her brother, and his
threats of imprisonment. Upon
the death of her brother, Henry
the Fourth, Isabella was the heir
to the throne. However, she met
with opposition, and it was only
after warring with the partisans
of her rival that she gained her
seat upon the throne. She reigned
jointly with her husband, and
their reign is spoken of as that of
Ferdinand and Isabella. It was
an eventful reign; many reforms
were introduced, justice was firmly
administered and crimes punished.
The nobility were restrained from
acts of oppression. Their reign
is also conspicuous for the conquest
of Granada; it is said that
the honors of the Moorish war
belonged by right to Isabella rather
than her husband, for she personally
directed the campaigns, and
during the ten years the war lasted
spent much of the time in camp.
There are some dark spots which
mar the brilliancy of this woman's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
record; one is the establishment of the Inquisition.</p>

<p>We find that when a certain cardinal of the
Roman Church presented his plan of the
"Spanish Inquisition" to the King
and Queen, that while Ferdinand
approved, Isabella hesitated for a
time; it may be that her woman's
heart made her hesitate to condemn
all who did not agree with
her in religious matters. Perhaps
you do not know what is meant by
the Inquisition.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 305px;">
<img src="images/illus56.jpg" width="305" height="445" alt="Old buildings, lightning in the background" />
<div class="caption">THE PRISON OF THE INQUISITION.</div>
</div>

<p>The Inquisition was a court
established for the purpose of
seeking out and punishing, or in
some cases banishing, heretics.
This meant all who were not
Romanists. I cannot think that
a woman so amiable, so kind and
so devout, had other than good
intentions in even this matter.
The King and Queen doubtless
had the best interests of their people
at heart, and they looked also
to the advancement of their church.
They wanted too to gain the favor
of the Pope. Doubtless there
was a variety of motives urging
them on; one writer says&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fear, piety, patriotism, absolutism
and ambition" all influenced
them.</p>

<p>And when we are inclined to
condemn our beautiful queen, we
must remember that she was educated
by a bigoted mother, that
she lived in bigoted times and that
her advisers were sustained by the highest
authority she recognized&mdash;the Papal court.
Let us judge her leniently and put the blame
of this act and of that other edict, the expulsion
of the Jews, elsewhere.</p>

<p>Let us think of her interest in Columbus,
for it was she who took an interest in his
project of seeking a new world beyond the seas,
and who offered even to part with her jewels in
order to furnish means for the carrying out of
his grand scheme.</p>

<p>We all know how it ended, and surely we
as Americans will ever cherish her memory.</p>


<p>She was a most gracious queen, beautiful in
face, pleasing in manner, and very loving as a
wife and mother. And among the royal personages
of her beloved Spain the name of Isabella
stands foremost.</p>

<h3>MUMMIES.&mdash;GAME FOR NEW YEAR'S NIGHT.</h3>

<div class='drop-cap'>"DO you think you could pick out your papa,
if you only saw his eyes?"</div>

<p>"Oh, what a question!" Ethel laughs in
great amusement. "I guess I couldn't help
knowing my papa, if I only saw one eye!"</p>

<p>Well, now you try it, Ethel, and let all the
others try it&mdash;this funny and perplexing game
of mummies.</p>

<p>Get the clothes-frame in from the kitchen,
cover it nicely with newspapers, first taking the
precaution to see that sheets or waterproofs
conceal all the bottom of it, for of course if you
saw your papa's boots sticking out, Ethel; or
you, Fred, saw just an inch of mamma's blue
gown that you think is just the prettiest gown in
all the world, why, then you could guess the eyes
that were above the boots or the gown!</p>

<p>If you have several pairs of eyes to guess at
the same time, it is necessary to paste the newspapers
securely together so as to admit back of
them, a row of people. Now then, cut holes in
your newspaper just large enough for a pair of
eyes to see through. This is a nice job to do, as
you will find out whoever does it for the first
time. You will be quite surprised to see that
your pair of holes look as if one eye was to be
on the further side of the cheek, and, as the children
say, "a mile too big," showing all the shading
of eyelashes and brows. You must expect
a shout at your expense as you triumphantly
stand up to fit them to the one who is waiting
to have them tried on him. But you will bear
the fun nicely, and join in it, I hope, for let me
tell you that no one who is unable to bear a joke
or a bit of nice fun at himself, ought to play
games. Why, the jolliest, loveliest companion
in a frolic is the girl or boy who is sweet-tempered,
and is so intent on making other people
happy that he or she has no time to get suspicious
in the mind that "somebody is laughing
at him." The member of a family party
who spoiled all the sweet fun of everybody, by
resentment in this way at every bit of amusement
started, thinking it pointed at him, was at
last, all patience exhausted, dubbed "Old Porcupine,"
because his quills were always out, angrily
trying to defend himself from nothing!</p>

<p>Don't you begin the New Year in this way,
will you, dear Pansies, but play your games
fairly, and in a kind, loving spirit.</p>

<p>Well, after you have your&mdash;not button-holes,
but&mdash;eye-holes all ready, and your frame completed,
you are all prepared for the company.
If you want a row of people to exhibit their
eyes, of course you must have a row of the holes.
Supposing you have only one. The frame is
placed in front of a door opening into another
room or a hall, from which the actors are to
come, the audience sitting on chairs on the other
side of the frame. Now a boy or girl who is
ready at speaking, and can say funny little things
nicely, must stand before the frame, and introduce
the strange beast or bird, or man or woman,
or child, or mummy, just what the showman
chooses to call it, to the assembled company.
He must say, "Ladies and gentlemen, this creature
is such a dangerous creature, that we can
show you nothing of it but its eyes, for it might
scare you. Walk up, ladies and gentlemen, and
examine it at your leisure, and tell the name of
this 'What is it?'" etc.</p>

<p>The audience after the conclusion of the
speech, are allowed to walk in front of the paper
frame, and give two guesses each, to whom the
eyes staring at them through the eye-holes belong.
If you make as wrong guesses as I do,
you will distinguish yourselves!</p>

<p>Then after every one has guessed who the
mummy is, and all wrongly, the showman commands
it to step out and show itself. Then
what shouts!</p>

<p>When all the mummies in the outer room have
been exhibited, the audience can take their
places, the former mummies taking the seats as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
guessers. If you choose, there can be a change
of showmen, and Ben, who did so nicely and
kept everybody laughing, will now, I am sure,
be willing to give his place to cousin Louise,
and the game will roll on fairly. May you have
great sport in it.</p>

<p>In future, when the game is a long one, involving
many words, there will be but one given.
"Round the Evening Lamp" must not crowd
out the other good things planned for the
Pansies, and we must all respect the printer.
When you grow up and write for magazines,
dear children, you will understand this!</p>

<h2>HEAT.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>THERE is no such thing as <i>cold</i>. When we
call a thing cold we only mean it has but
little heat in it, for everything, even <i>ice</i>, has some
heat in it.</div>

<p>We can readily measure the amount of heat
in different things, and we know a great deal
about how it acts, but we really do not know
what it is. Heat is never <i>by itself</i>, but always
with something else. We may have hot water,
we may have hot iron, but no one has ever
been able to divide the heat from the water or
iron, and keep it divided.</p>

<p>We can easily make heat pass from one thing
into another, but when things which have different
amounts of heat are put together the heat
will spread itself around so as to make all of the
same temperature. A piece of iron put into
fire becomes hot, because the warmth passes
from the fire into the iron until both have the
game amount of heat.</p>

<p>Most of the heat in the world comes from the
sun. We can set fire to things by gathering
the sun's rays and bringing them to a point with
a lens.</p>

<p>Ice, you well know, "is water in a solid state.
It is formed under the influence of extreme cold.
It is a nearly solid, transparent, brittle substance,
of a crystalline structure. It melts into water at
the temperature of thirty-two degrees Fahrenheit."</p>

<p>In hot countries ice is made in a machine
worked on philosophic principles.&mdash;<i>Selected.</i></p>

<h2>SKATING IN HOLLAND.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>HOLLAND is the country for skating. People
of all ages engage in it. The rivers
there are very numerous. It is a pretty sight
to see a grand plain of ice covered with persons
thus amusing themselves. The most skilful
skater is at the head; each catches the coat of
the one before him&mdash;the weakest in the middle.</div>

<p>Some of the best-trained ones perform all
manner of dexterous tricks, much to the amusement
of the great crowds. A good skater makes
twelve miles an hour. Some who do not like
skating have a curious sledge, resembling a ship,
in which you may go twenty-four miles an hour.
Is not that very wonderful?</p>

<p>They fasten to the vessel a very strong piece
of iron which cuts into the ice. It has a sail
larger than that of a real vessel of the same size,
so the wind propels it, and it is steered as though
on water. This, however, is quite a dangerous
amusement. They are often dashed against
something and broken to pieces. Besides, some
cannot endure cutting the air at such a speed.</p>

<p>It is a grand sight to see all things like a fine
panorama before you whilst travelling at lightning
speed, in one of those singular sledges. In
these they often go from Amsterdam to Saardam;
this latter place is one of the nicest in Holland.
The houses are wooden, and all nicely painted.
The people are so neat that they will not permit
a carriage to pass through their streets. Wealthy
Dutch merchants reside here. Here Peter the
Great once worked as a carpenter, to learn ship-building.
Near by are two thousand windmills,
and one for grinding coffee, and also sawmills,
which saw thirty planks at a time.</p>

<p>There is a story told which I think will amuse
you. An ambassador wrote to the Emperor of
Morocco, that during certain seasons all the
rivers of the Netherlands were covered with
something resembling sugar-candy, and which
could bear horses and carriages, and that vast
multitudes glided over these cakes like ostriches,
with smooth irons fastened to their feet. The
Emperor thought this so marvellous that he
called him a story-teller.</p>

<p>The people are very reckless; sometimes go
gliding over the ice in sledges when it is really
bending under their weight.</p>

</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">I STARTED from Walnut Hills. You
may not find the name in your geographies,
so I will just hint to you that it
is one of the parlors of Cincinnati; <i>that</i>
you can find.</div>

<p>Down Gilbert Avenue in a car which made
good progress, notwithstanding its frequent
stops to take on more people. "Who makes it
go?" asked a wee girlie who was evidently taking
her first ride of the kind. Sure enough!
Who did? No horse or mule; no engine to be
seen; no visible means of making that car slip
over the road as it did.</p>

<p>The child repeated her eager question:
"Mamma, who makes it go? There isn't any
horsie."</p>

<p>"It is a cable car, my child," the mother answered,
with a look of profound wisdom in her
eyes.</p>

<p>"What is a cable car, mamma?"</p>

<p>"It is a car that goes without horses."</p>

<p>"But what <i>makes</i> it go?" was the third time
repeated query. Then the small questioner, and
I, listened for words of wisdom from the mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
lips. "I told you, Alice, it was a cable car;
now be quiet; you ask too many questions." I
think Alice and I came to the same conclusion;
that the mother did not understand how to explain
a cable car, and did not want to own it.</p>

<p>Now you are asking <i>me</i> what a cable car is.
Oh, dear! I don't understand how to tell you;
and I will own it. I have questioned until it is
pretty clear to me, but as I said, I don't know
how to tell it. You see, the one who explained
it to me, seated me in a chair at one side, and
said: "You are the engine." This astonishing
statement held me quiet, while he put into my
hand a tiny cord which he said was a very strong
and heavy band. Being bound to believe him,
I watched the band placed around a great wheel,
on the street in front of me. Away down the
street, about two miles, was another wheel, and
a rope which had neither beginning nor end was
placed around both wheels; at least that was
what "he" said. To be sure, it looked to me
like the study table, and an inkstand, and a tin
can with some twine around them. But since <i>I</i>
was an engine, why could not they be two great
wheels connected by a rope? "Now," said the
speaker, "you&mdash;being the engine, you understand&mdash;are
set in motion, and the band about
you being connected with this great wheel, when
the band moves, the great wheels do the same,
and the iron rope responds, and moves round and
round. Now here comes along a car" (it wasn't,
it was a spool of thread; never mind!) "here
comes along a car drawn by horses; but this a
steep ascent" (it was as level as the floor), "and
they want to use engine power, so they take off
the horses, and a little contrivance underneath
grasps the chain, and away goes the car. Understand?"</p>

<p>Yes, I understand, after a fashion. The question
is, Do you? Well, we went down town on
the cable car.</p>

<p>Arrived at the city, we went with speed to a
music store, made our way up stairs to the "parlors."
We were late; every chair taken; very
little standing room left. We found some, however,
to stand in, and were glad even for this
opportunity of hearing the sweet-voiced speaker.
Who who she? Her name is Layah Barrakat.</p>

<p>A strange-sounding name? Oh, yes, she is a
foreigner. Her birthplace is away among the
mountains of Lebanon. Once she was a little
heathen girl; and the strange sad things she
told would have made the tears come to your
eyes. If ever you hear or read that Layah
Barrakat is to speak on Foreign Missions in any
building near where you live, I want you to be
sure to hear her.</p>

<p>Let me tell you the story of a pair of red
shoes. Our missionaries had a Sabbath-school
near where Layah lived; but she had been
taught that it was a very wicked place, and she
must have nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>One day a lady from the Mission met Layah
and invited her to Sabbath-school, telling her
she would make her a present of a pair of new
shoes if she would come. Layah wanted the
shoes; she told her mother about it and begged
to go, just once, to get the shoes, promising she
would not listen to, or remember a word that
was said; so the mother agreed, and she went.
But there she heard such wonderful things she
could not help listening, and remembering; for
the first time she heard about Jesus; how he
loved her very much, and had a beautiful home
waiting for her, and would show her the way to
it if she would follow him. In all her life Layah
had never heard of anything like this. She
wanted to follow the kind friend who loved her.
She received her shoes, beautiful red ones, and
she thought a good deal of them, but when Sunday
came again she wanted to go back to the
school, and hear more about Jesus. She did
not dare tell her mother of her wish, for she
knew punishment would follow; but at last her
desire to go grew so strong that she ran away.
Her brother found out where she was, and came
for her, scolding and whipping her all the way
home.</p>

<p>But all the scolding could not take from her
what she had learned. It is a long story, the
trials she went through, and the punishments she
received for wanting to be a Christian. She
used to be cruelly whipped, and shut up in a
dark cellar without anything to eat. But it was
all to no purpose; she had heard enough of
Jesus to make her hungry for <i>him</i>. Nothing
else would satisfy her; she was determined to
follow him, cost what it might.</p>

<p>By and by, good Doctor Nassau, a missionary,
became interested in her; he wrote to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
friends in America, telling her story, and a Sabbath-school
in West Philadelphia determined to
adopt and educate her. So they gathered their
pennies, and sent them out, and Layah went to
the mission school; but she had to run away
from home in order to do so.</p>

<p>The story of her life since then reads almost
like a fairy tale; one can hardly imagine it possible
that all the strange experiences of which
she tells, could have come to her. How she
grew up, and married, and went to Egypt as a
missionary; how her brother, the very one who
used to whip her through the streets, became a
Christian, and a teacher in the Mission; how
her mother, soon after, learned to love Jesus;
how Layah saved many little girls in Egypt;
how when the troubles came there, she escaped
with her husband and child, after suffering
dreadful things, and came to this country, and
went wandering through the streets of Philadelphia,
in search of one man whom she had met
in Egypt&mdash;Dr. Dulles Chestnuts&mdash;this was his
name, as she remembered it.</p>

<p>How the children of the streets chased them,
calling them gypsies, how the very dogs barked
at them, how she sat down at last on a doorstep,
and cried to think that she had come to Christian
America, and could find no friend; all these
things are deeply interesting. I wish you could
have heard her tell them.</p>

<p>Was it not wonderful that at last she should
have found the very friend whom she sought?
a policeman spoke kindly to her, took her into a
store, looked in a directory for her, and found
that her friend was Doctor Dulles, on Chestnut
street. After that, the way to rest and help was
smooth; she began to realize that she was indeed
in a Christian country.</p>

<p>For three years she has been living in Philadelphia.
She goes over the country to visit
churches, and Mission Bands, wherever she is
invited, to tell her beautiful, and sorrowful, and
joyful, and altogether wonderful story.</p>

<h2>AT NUMBER FIVE.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-t.jpg" width="59" height="112" alt="T" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">THE scholars at Number Five, or many
of them, brought a noon-day lunch instead
of going home to dinner. And
very pleasant times they had, sitting
under the trees in summer, picnic fashion,
or gathering in little groups in doors, in
winter. Sometimes they had games after lunch,
and sometimes the teacher told stories. One
day she told them a story of a missionary hen,
and straightway several of the scholars determined
to have missionary hens. Helen Lynch
pondered the matter, but saw no way of getting
the hen. Her father might give her one, but
she was not sure; she had heard him say that
missions were a humbug, and she had little hope
of his co-operation in the scheme. She was
walking slowly along the river path when she
heard a fluttering on the bank and a sound which
seemed like that of a bird in distress. Putting
down her lunch basket and umbrella she went
to see what was the matter and found hid among
the tall grass a young duck that seemed to be
hurt in some way.</div>

<div>
<img src="images/illus67a.jpg" alt="flowers and ducks" width="110" height="95" class="split" />
<img src="images/illus67b.jpg" alt="flowers and ducks" width="196" height="58" class="split" />

<img src="images/illus67e.jpg" alt="flowers and ducks" width="361" height="169" class="split" />
</div>

<p>"It must be Mr. Brown's," she said to herself,
"for I do not know of any one else who has
young ducks," and she took the frightened and
suffering duck in her arms and carried it to Mr.
Brown, but that gentleman looking down upon
the little girl smilingly said, "See here, little one,
what would you do with it if it were yours?"</p>

<p>"I'd try to make it well, and then I'd make a
missionary duck of it."</p>

<p>"A missionary duck! What is that?"</p>

<p>Then Helen explained that a missionary hen
was one the proceeds of which in eggs and
chickens were set apart by the owner for missionary
money and of course a missionary duck
would be the same. Mr. Brown laughed.
"Well, that is a funny idea. Suppose I give
you a pair&mdash;that is, I will give you this one if
you will cure it, and I will give you a mate to it
and we will see how much money you make out
of the investment."</p>


<p>Helen's eyes danced with pleasure. The
wounded duck soon recovered, and before the
end of summer she had quite a flock of young
ducks which afforded her no end of enjoyment.
True she had to watch them closely and look out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
for her mischievous brothers lest her flock come
to harm, but she did not mind the trouble.
Meantime there was a great interest growing up
among the scholars in missionary enterprises.
There were missionary hens and turkeys; missionary
cabbages and turnips, and even missionary
pigs. The months
went by and Thanksgiving
was near at hand. After
considerable thinking as
to the feasibility of the
scheme,
Miss Lee,
the teacher
in Number
Five, proposed
a plan by which some of the chickens and
turkeys might be disposed of to good advantage.
Willie Smith was the owner of a small printing
press, and about two weeks before Thanksgiving
twenty tickets bearing the words,
"Thanksgiving dinner at two o'clock at the
schoolhouse. Admit one," were put into the
hands of two of the most energetic boys to
be sold at forty cents each.</p>
<div>
<img src="images/illus70a.jpg" alt="flowers and ducks" width="110" height="107" class="splitr" />
<img src="images/illus70b.jpg" alt="flowers and ducks" width="298" height="270" class="splitr" />
</div>

<p>"There are a number of people in the neighborhood
who will be glad to get a nice dinner
and save themselves the hard work of getting it
up," reasoned Miss Lee. "Mrs. Graves told me
the other day that she should not try for anything
extra this year on account of her lame
wrist, and Miss Smith is so lonely since her
brother went away, I am sure she will be glad to
eat her dinner in good company."</p>

<p>Sure enough the twenty tickets were soon
sold and more called for. Twenty more were
sent out. "That is positively all we can accommodate,"
said Miss Lee. The dinner was a
success. Four large turkeys, three ducks and a
chicken pie or two were disposed of. Interested
fathers and mothers had lent some slight assistance,
but for the most part the work was done
by Miss Lee and the scholars. The
forty guests were well pleased with
their dinner. The tired mothers
were grateful in their hearts to Miss
Lee for the thought which had
given them a rest; surely it was
to them a day of Thanksgiving.</p>

<p>At the end of the feast
Mr. Brown arose and
moved a vote of thanks
to their entertainers,
which being properly seconded
and carried the
gentleman continued, "I
suppose it is well understood
that we have
been feasting upon
missionary turkeys, and
missionary hens, and
missionary ducks as well
as other good things to
which the same adjective
belongs. Now I trust
that none of us suppose
for one instant that <i>we</i> have given one cent to the
mission cause by coming here to eat our dinner
and paying a small sum for it. That is purely
a business transaction; these young people have
earned the money, and I congratulate them
upon their enterprise. Now I understand that
they have several turkeys and ducks as well as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
other things left over. And I wish to call out an
expression from the friends here who have enjoyed
their hospitality to-day. Shall we have
our Christmas dinner prepared for us at the
same place and under the same auspices? All
in favor say 'aye.'"</p>

<p>Then such a shout as went up seemed almost
to raise the roof. A little time was spent socially,
during which Mr. Brown told the story of
the lame duck, and added as he finished, "Our
little Helen here gave me an idea and I do not
know but I may as well tell you that I have a
missionary cow nowadays!" Presently the diners-out
went to their homes, leaving the young
people to their dinner and their work of clearing
up.</p>

<h2>A WORD IN SEASON.</h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-capi" src="images/drop-b.jpg" width="62" height="86" alt="B" />
</div>
<div class="drop-capi2">BERTIE and his mother were spending
the summer at the Thousand Islands;
they had a pretty cottage that overlooked
the river, and Bertie was very
fond of watching the never-ceasing ripple of the
waters, and he learned to look for the different
boats that ply the waters of the St. Lawrence
during the season. One day an excursion boat
touched the pier and a company of gayly dressed
soldiers stepped off. What boy's heart does not
beat quicker at the sight of a finely-uniformed
military company? Bertie was no exception to
the rule, and gave his mother no rest until she
had promised to take him out into the park
where he could see the soldiers. And accordingly
after dinner they strolled out and Mrs.
Grant and a friend found seats under the trees
where they could read or talk and keep an eye
upon the restless boy.</div>

<p>Just before leaving home for the Islands Bertie
had been taught a bit of a poem which he had
recited at a Sunday-school concert. One line
ran:</p>

<div class='center'>
I'm a little soldier fighting for the right.<br />
</div>

<p>The soldiers were strolling about in pairs
and singly, and Bertie stood near the fountain
watching a fine-looking fellow who had stopped
for a cool drink of sparkling water. Suddenly
the words of his recitation came into his mind
and without hesitation he stepped up to the
stranger and said:</p>

<p>"Man, are you a soldier fighting for the
right?" and then stood still looking at the soldier
as if waiting for a reply.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"Oh,</p>

<div class='center'>
I'm a little soldier fighting for the right!"<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>and then, Bertie seized with a sudden spasm of
timidity, ran away to find his mother.</div>

<p>The soldier's name was John Lewis; he turned
away and rejoined his companions, but the words
of the fair-faced, soft-voiced
child still sounded in his ear.
He was <i>not</i> fighting for the
right; he was perfectly well
aware that he had enlisted upon
the side of the leader who is
bound to oppose the right
under all circumstances.</p>

<p>He knew that the banner under which he was
marching had sin written all over it. It was
Satan's banner, and he was doing work for that
leader that was telling upon his own life. It
already, young as he was, began to show in his
face, in his unsteady step and foul breath. He
knew that so surely was he bound to the service
of that master, that if he could have found a
glass of liquor upon the grounds he would not
have stopped to drink at the fountain, and
would not have given Bertie the opportunity
for his childish questioning.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>Some way, the voice would not be stilled.
"Fighting for the right!" If not, why not? Because
I am a fool; he did not say this aloud, but
in his own heart he knew it was true. And
there came to him the memory of a quiet country
village, of a little sitting-room, a round stand,
a Bible, a chair where he knew that mother often
knelt and prayed for him, asking that he might
be led to enlist under that other banner, even the
banner of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>"What is going on under that big tent?"
asked one of his comrades.</p>

<p>"They are having some sort of a religious
meeting, I reckon," replied another.</p>

<p>"We may as well stroll over that way and
look in for a while. It will do no harm to mix
in a little religion, I suppose."</p>

<p>And so the three "looked in" upon a religious
service held in the great tabernacle. Strangely
enough the speaker who occupied the platform
uttered words which exactly matched John
Lewis' mood. The others thought them commonplace
enough, but to John Lewis' newly-awakened
consciousness they seemed simply
wonderful.</p>

<p>"That man is fighting for the right," he said
to himself; "now if <i>I</i> were! What if I <i>should</i>
turn right about and resign my commission in
Satan's army and enlist in the army of the Lord?
What if I should now? Wouldn't the boys
stare?" and he chuckled inwardly over the
thought of their amazement at such a move on
his part. "And what would mother say? I
don't know but she would die of joy. That
would be a pity, but, after all, it might be better
than to die of grief, and I reckon she'll do that
if I keep on fighting under the old leader. I
believe I will make a swap."</p>

<p>"Next summer" had come. Again John
Lewis joined his comrades on an excursion to
the Islands; again he drank from the fountain,
and as he turned away he said to a friend:</p>

<p>"It was right here that the little fellow asked
me that question. I would like to see him again
and tell him I am fighting for the right now."</p>

<p>But Bertie was not to know of the result of
his interest in the stranger. He has never seen
his soldier friend since that day of his first missionary
effort, but we hope that both are still
fighting for the right.</p>

<div class='right'>
<i>September 16, 1885.</i><br />
</div>
<div class='unindent'><span class="smcap">My Dear Pansies</span>:</div>


<p>I hope you will never see such a sad sight as
our little children saw this evening. A Turcoman
who has his tent in our yard was beating
his poor wife, and the little children&mdash;his children,
I mean&mdash;were running away screaming.
You would think their houses very curious were
you to see them. His wives build his house for
him in a very short time when the fleas become
so plenty that they are compelled to move. The
materials consist of a ridgepole, some boards,
and two wooden troughs, one for each side.
Crotched sticks are driven in to hold the ridgepole,
the pole laid across, and the boards set up
against it with the ends placed in the troughs
which are for the purpose of carrying off the
rain. This man's mother lives in a tent of black
cloth made of goat's hair. Poor old woman!
She has quite a number of grandchildren whom
one would think she might pet, but she sits nursing
and fondling a little kid. It is a pretty
sight to see the great flock of goats go out in the
morning, and come home in the evening. There
are black, white, gray and mottled. Some are
huge fellows, as large as a calf. A few nights
ago a wild beast of some kind caught a kid.
The kid made an outcry, and the dogs came and
rescued it. We heard afterwards that the beast
was a leopard, which has its den about half a
mile away from us. It has carried off seven
goats from one of our neighbors.</p>

<p>Now I must tell you a little about our schoolgirls.
There are nine. Two of these are Moslems
and had heard nothing about the true religion
except what little they may have learned
from their brother, who was last year baptized
into the Christian church. Since coming here
in the last of June they have committed to memory
all of the Short Catechism known in English
as Brown's, and ten Psalms. The eldest a
few days ago when taking some gum arabic to
her teacher, took a lump and hid it away. Some
of the girls saw her trying to hide something
away, and found out what it was. Her teacher
then talked to her, and told her how wrong she
had done. Since then she asked if it was stealing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
to taste the food as she was cooking it. It
is so new to them to be taught that it is wrong
to break the Sabbath, to tell lies or to steal, if
the article stolen is of little value. The man of
whom I told you above says of us, "Ah, you
have everything very nice here, and we have
nothing, but hereafter you will be tormented,
and we will be happy in the Paradise that Mohammed
has prepared for us." Is it not sad to
think of such delusion? This very man cheats
on all hands, and is even said to be connected
with a gang of thieves.</p>

<p>And now I will give you an instance of an
Arab's self-respect. A day or two ago a man
brought three quails, and said such a man had
sent them as a present to the doctor. The doctor
thanked him, and then the man wanted a
present for bringing them. "Give him the quails,"
said the doctor, and off he went with them again.</p>

<p>I could fill pages with accounts of the dreadful
effects of heathenism on this people, but it is
only what is seen in every place where the Gospel
has not yet gone. This is the hardest trial
of the missionaries' life&mdash;more than any physical
deprivation&mdash;the being compelled to live
among such people. It always makes me think
what a long martyrdom the life of our blessed
Saviour must have been on earth. It was not
only that he <i>saw</i> and <i>heard</i> such things, but he
knew every <i>thought</i> in the wicked hearts of
those about him. Dear little sisters, will you
not begin even in your childhood to work for
Him? To <i>deny</i> yourselves that these benighted
miserable people all over the world may have
this Gospel light? And you can always pray
for those who are engaged in this work. I hope
some of you may grow up to go far away to the
Gentiles yourselves.</p>

<p>A little Moslem child accounted for her preference
for the Christian religion by saying, "I
like your Jesus because he loves little girls.
Our Mohammed did not love little girls."
With unerring instinct she had seized upon at
least one of the great differences between the
two religions.</p>

<h2>GIVE GOD THE BEST.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE following touching story is told of a
poor Hindoo mother, a native of Kedgeree
in India:</div>

<p>This woman lived on the Ganges, near Sanger
Island. She was the mother of a pair of
beautiful twin babies. But one of these children
was a girl, and the poor benighted mother
on that account supposed herself to be under
"Gunga's" curse for some offence she had committed.</p>

<p>A missionary's wife found her lamenting, and
heard the story of her grief. The god must be
appeased, the woman said. He was certainly
angry, or the children would have both been
boys, and with good eyes. She would have to
make a sacrifice to soothe his wrath.</p>

<p>The Christian lady did what she could to impress
her with better teachings, but with little
effect. She left her sadly, never for one moment
dreaming what the wretched mother meditated
doing.</p>

<p>A day or two later the lady called again. As
before, the mother sat beside the little basket
cradle weeping&mdash;for this time there was but
one baby in the cradle. It was the poor little
blind girl. The other had been drowned in the
Ganges.</p>

<p>The Christian lady was horror-struck when she
knew the truth.</p>

<p>"Unhappy woman!" she exclaimed; "if you
were driven to do this, why did you destroy
the child you loved, and spare the one you
hated?"</p>

<p>The woman sobbed and beat her breast piteously.</p>

<p>"O, it is that that breaks my heart," she said.
"The god must have the <i>best</i>. When I had a
perfect one he would not take the other. Alas,
my boy, my boy!"</p>

<p>Why should not many who live in this land of
light be shamed&mdash;not by the deed, but by the
devotion of this poor heathen? Under the gentle
law of Christ, we know that God's demand
for the best we have only bids us use it for him,
and devote it to him.</p>

<p>If we serve him selfishly, may not even the
poor dark-souled Hindoo mother rise up and
condemn us?&mdash;<i>Selected.</i></p>

<div class='drop-cap'>HAPPY NEW YEAR! Only three little
words, yet how much they mean! Isn't
it a wonderful thought that it rests with each
one of you to decide whether you will be happy
this year or not? Now I see you open your
eyes! "How, can we tell what is going to
happen to us?"</div>

<p>Ah, I did not say that; but don't you know,
if you are soldiers of the great King, he will
take care of you; and whatever happens will
give you the sweetest, highest happiness there is
in this world?</p>

<p>We talk about things "happening," but it is
well for us to remember that this King of ours
manages all things, and is pledged to make "all
things work together for good," to those who
belong to him.</p>

<p>How many of you are blooming for him?</p>

<p>How many of you who have not yet settled
the question, will come over to His side before
this New Year's Day is done?</p>

<p>Oh, I hope you are all preparing for a Happy
New Year.</p>

Lovingly,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       <span class="smcap">Pansy</span>.<br />
</div>


<p><i>Fred</i> from Rhode Island. I am sorry your
"other letter" was not answered, but glad that
you did not wait for it. It is so pleasant to
hear that the badges help our young people. So
you found <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> blooming where you did
not expect it? The truth is, we Pansies are a
very large family, and are wonderfully scattered.
I have marked your letter to be copied, for the
other Blossoms to enjoy.</p>

<p><i>Mary</i> and <i>John</i> from Tarsus. Dear, far-away
Blossoms, we welcome you. How strange it is
to think that in the very country where the great
Paul lived so many years ago, two little Pansy
buds are growing for Jesus. I hope you may
be very fragrant flowers in that far-away land.
Will you give my love to little Robert Livingstone?</p>

<p><i>Gertrude</i> from New York. I am glad for you.
"Whining" is a habit very easy to form, and
very hard to break. It requires a good, strong
resolution, such as you have made. As for
"prompt obedience," I heard a gentleman once
say, that no one was fit to command, who had
not learned to obey.</p>

<p><i>Grace</i> from Pennsylvania. You have asked
a hard question, my dear. How can we interest
people in things in which they have no interest?
Let us see. In the first place, we must be very
much interested ourselves, and must know just
why we are interested, and just what we hope
to do, by securing others to join us. Many of
the P. S. have weekly meetings where they do
some benevolent work, and have many an interesting
book read to them while they work.
Others have a literary society. What have you
tried to do? Tell us the whole story, and we
will try to help you.</p>

<p><i>Susie</i> from Pennsylvania. The "Whisper
Motto" is: "<i>For Jesus' Sake</i>." All the Pansies
who choose it for their motto are expected to
try to live by it. To do nothing which they
think Jesus would not like, and to take him for
their pattern. I am glad you like <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>.</p>

<p><i>Nettie</i> from Ohio. Dear little Blossom, I was
very much interested in your letter. I read it
to a friend who said she would send you <span class="smcap">The
Pansy</span> for one year, for a Christmas present.
So you may expect it to visit you as usual. I
am glad you and your little sisters like it so well.
For a little girl who has never been to school, I
think you write an excellent letter.</p>

<p><i>Harriet</i> from Deddington. So a little American
Blossom has gone to bloom in England!
That is good. May the fragrance of your life
be enough to give joy to all around you. Did
you ever notice how easy it is to find things to
fret about, if one only tries?</p>

<p><i>Edith</i> from New York. Now, my dear, I
hope you will this time understand that you are
the "Edith" meant. I would like to make it
"sound like you" if I could. Since you live in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>

Chautauqua County, perhaps you have been to
the beautiful Chautauqua, where so many young
people go every summer.</p>

<p><i>Richard</i> from Virginia. We welcome you,
my boy. If you succeed in raising a P. S. company,
an officer's badge will be sent you in
place of the one you now have. The habit of
using "by-words" seems to be growing among
our young people, both girls and boys. I am
glad for every one who joins the ranks to fight
against it.</p>

<p><i>Myra</i> from New York. My wee Blossom, I
was glad to receive your letter. So you want
to write "nice stories"? Well, who can tell
but you may write beautiful stories, one of these
days? I'll tell you what you might begin to do
now. <i>Live</i> a story, a beautiful one, so that
people who know you will say one to another,
"How gentle, and unselfish, and truthful, and
loving <i>Myra</i> is!" How would that do? Yes,
I know it is much harder to <i>live</i> stories than it
is to write them; but then, they are worth
more.</p>

<p><i>Bessie</i> and <i>Gracie</i> from Wisconsin. Two
dear sisters who are going to "help each other."
I know all about that habit of impatience, Bessie;
ever so many people are troubled with it. As
for "contradicting," I have spent part of the
day with a boy who contradicted his mother
five times in the course of half an hour. Think
of it!</p>

<p><i>Miriam</i> from New Jersey. You have chosen
a fault which is very common, and very trying to
one's friends. "Slow obedience is only <i>half</i>
obedience," a dear old friend of mine used to
say. I have often thought of it; and I believe
it is quite true. Do not you? I think you must
have had a pleasant time at your celebration.</p>

<p><i>Stella</i> from Omaha. Your pledge reminds me
of a day when I was looking through a gentleman's
autograph album, and came to a name
which I could not pronounce. This was it:
Inaminute. "What is this name?" I asked, in
wonder. The young man laughed. "Oh, that
was one of our boys who was always keeping
us waiting; he was sure to shout out: "In a
minute!" no matter how much haste we were
in. So we took to calling him that; and the
name stuck, somehow, and fits to this day.
Some one told me only yesterday, that he never
succeeded in anything he undertook, because he
was always behindhand."</p>

<p><i>Harry</i> from Pennsylvania. "A better boy in
every way that I can." That is a grand pledge,
Harry. It has given me great comfort to write
it out in full on our pledge book, and to think
while I am writing it, what a grand man there
will be in Pennsylvania, one of these days, if
Harry lives, and keeps his pledge. I pray God
to help you every day to keep it.</p>

<p><i>May</i> from New York. A May flower that
shall help somebody every day, will be sure to
shed sweet perfume. I hope my little May
will blossom some day in our Father's garden,
where flowers never fade.</p>

<p><i>Bella</i> from Canada. A Pansy Blossom in
Canada! Yes, indeed, many of them. This
one we welcome with special joy because you
are such a wee bud; only six, and pledged to
try to make sunshine for the people around you,
every day. God bless our little Canadian
Bella!</p>

<p><i>Cora</i> from New York. Poor little "finger
nails!" I am glad they are not to suffer any
more. A lady once told me that she was so in
the habit of biting her nails, that when she
stood before a great audience once, to speak on
temperance, she found herself tugging at her
glove to get to her fingers so she could bite
them! Would not that have been an astonishing
sight? Habit is a strange tyrant. Break away
from this one, while you are young.</p>

<p><i>Henry</i> from New York. Good for you, my
boy! Half-learned lessons are very common,
and very disgraceful. Please don't wear your
badge at all, on any day when you fail in a lesson;
I should hate to think of its being treated
in that way.</p>

<p><i>Clyde</i> from Virginia. Welcome to our Pansy
Society. What kind word have you said this
month, I wonder, that has helped some one on
his way. A kind word a day, would make a
lovely chain of kindness each year. Then, if we
could follow the words and see what they did
for others, what a story they would make!</p>

<p><i>Mary</i> from Indiana. So you have overcome
that habit of saying "Wait a minute." How
glad mamma must be! I rejoice with you.
What are you going to take up next? I presume
Satan keeps you busy fighting against his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
wishes. He is very industrious, and when he
fails in one direction, he tries in another.</p>

<p><i>Frankie</i> from Michigan. I hope mamma was
not only surprised but pleased with the badge,
and your reason for receiving it. Does she see
you growing patient? That is not an easy lesson
to learn. In fact it takes a great deal of
patience to be patient!</p>

<p><i>Ida</i> from Kansas. Your pledge was rather
indefinite, my dear. I have not a very clear
idea of what you mean to do. However, if <i>you</i>
have, and are trying for it, the main point has
been gained. Perhaps you will write and make
the matter plainer to me.</p>

<p><i>George</i> from Minnesota. I know a boy who
has taught himself to be so cross to his little sister
that she actually cries sometimes, when she
sees him coming. Yet he loves her, and would
shed bitter tears if God where to take her away.
Why do you suppose he wants to heap up sad
memories for himself, by yielding to such a foolish
habit? I am glad you have taken the pledge
you send.</p>

<p><i>Nellie</i> from &mdash;&mdash; If one only gets used to it,
my dear, it is really quite an easy thing to do a
thing at once, as it is to linger awhile. In fact
it is easier; there is such a delightful feeling
about having a thing done that we did not want
to do. A young girl told me once that she remembered
a certain summer day in which life
was bright to her, all day, because she succeeded
in making her bed before her mother said to her,
"Come, dear, it is time your morning work was
done."</p>

<h2>A BOX-FULL OF HAPPINESS.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>DO you know where it came from? Far
down in Maine, four little girls, Lottie,
Sibbie, Minnie and May, looked into each other's
eyes one day, and with hearts full of love for the
suffering little children who could not run and
play as they did, they resolved to give up some
of their time each day to preparing a box for a
children's hospital.</div>

<p>The box was some happy weeks in growing.
Dollies after being dressed by patient little fingers,
hopped into it gladly as if to say, "Just
think of me going to comfort a little sick child.
I am <i>so glad</i> to go." Cunning little wooden
barrels and boxes that were manufactured in
that Maine village, rolled and tumbled in too;
toys that looked as if then their whole mission
in life were to amuse hospital children, tucked
themselves into all the nooks and corners until
I can whisper to you all, dear members of the
Pansy Society, <i>there wasn't a bit of room left</i>.</p>

<p>Oh, what a rich box! The dear little girls,
those four members of the Pansy Society who
believed in making others happy <i>for Jesus' sake</i>,
put the precious box on the cars all nicely addressed
to Boston. It travelled and travelled
till it came to my hands; and then it took a wee
journey to the hospital where it was opened by
the good head nurse, who is superintendent of
the wards.</p>

<p>I can do no better than to give you her words
in the letter she stopped in her busy life to write
me concerning its arrival. She speaks of the
reception of the box, "that your little friends
from Maine so kindly and lovingly put up for
the sick children, and can I trouble you with
one message of 'thank you'? Our hands are full,
and all playthings are appreciated. One of the
dolls has fallen to a little girl who has recently
been through a very serious operation. She
clings to it night and day, and as she is too sick
to have the out-of-bed children play with or
about her bed, dollie is quite sure to be long-lived."</p>

<p>Only think of the blessed mission of that one
doll! That the suffering child away from its
mother can "cling to it day and night." O,
children, is there any sacrifice too great to be
made to have the blessed privilege of comforting
Christ's little ones, and helping them bear their
sufferings!</p>

<p>Dear Minnie, Lottie, Sibbie and May, your
"box-full of happiness" will never cease growing.
It has made the little hospital children
happy, and your own hearts warm and tender
with the love that is like unto Christ's. May this
New Year bring to you and to all the members
of the Pansy Society many sweet, loving thoughts
and desires toward making others happy. This
is the best wish of my heart for you.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Margaret Sidney.</span><br />
</div>

<p>P. S. Will the four little Maine girls please
send me their address? The old one has been
lost, and I want to write them a letter.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 255px;">

<h2>THE PANSY SOCIETY<br />
<br />
P. S.</h2>

<div class='drop-cap'>THE motto of the Society is "Pansies for Thoughts." What kind of thoughts? Oh, sweet, good, pure, unselfish,
hopeful thoughts, such as Pansies, beautiful Pansies ought to inspire.</div>

<p>Now "who may join?"</p>

<p>Every boy and girl who takes the <span class="smcap">Pansy</span>, and is willing to promise to try to overcome his or her faults, to
encourage every good impulse, to try to conquer some hard lesson at school, to do anything that shows a disposition
to help the cause of right in the world. Any one who will say from the heart: "I promise to try
each day to do some kind act, or to say some kind word that shall help somebody;" honest effort will be accepted
as much as if success were gained.</p>

<p>This promise must be dated, and will be copied into the "P. S." roll-book.</p>

<p>The most important of all to remember is our whisper motto: "I will do it for Jesus' sake."</p>

<div class='center'>
<b>"FOR JESUS' SAKE."</b><br />
</div>

<p>Whatever He will own, the "P. S." will be proud and glad to copy on its roll-book.</p>

<p>Then you must write a letter to Pansy (Mrs. G. R. Alden, Cincinnati, O.), saying that you thus pledge
yourself, and you will become a member of the Pansy Society, and receive a badge.</p>

<p>Now, about the badges.</p>

<p>The officer's is of satin, trimmed with gilt fringe, and has a gilt pin to fasten the badge to the dress or coat.
In the centre is a pansy in colors&mdash;above it the words, <i>Pansy Society</i>, and beneath it, <i>Pansies for Thoughts</i>.</p>

<p>The badge for members will be the same as the officer's, with the exception of having no fringe and a silver
pin.</p>

<p>And the <span class="smcap">Pansy</span> will help. As it has always been glad to encourage those who are struggling up toward the
light, so now it reaches forth its helping hand to those little ones who will rally bravely around it, to the work
of putting down the evil, and the support of all things good and beautiful.</p>

<p>So many of you have little brothers and sisters who want to join the P. S., and who of course do not need
an extra copy of the paper, that we have concluded to receive all such, letting them pay ten cents each for
their badges, if they wish them. Understand! If you are a subscriber to <span class="smcap">The Pansy</span>, and have a badge, and
have a little sister who would like a badge, write at her dictation a little letter to Pansy, taking the pledge,
telling of some habit which she means to try to break, and enclosing twelve cents in two-cent stamps, ten to
pay for the badge, and two to pay the postage for sending it. Her name will be enrolled as if she were a subscriber.
The same advice applies of course to little brothers. Send your letters to Mrs. <span class="smcap">G. R. Alden</span>,
Chapel Street, Walnut Hills, Cincinnati, O.</p>

<p>It is also asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>What makes an officer of the Pansy Society?</p>

<p>You are to endeavor to organize a club of as many members as you can. Each one forming such a Club or
Society will receive the Officer's badge, and become President of the same. The local Society may contain as
many members as can be secured.</p>

<p>Then, of course, you will plan for your Society; how often it shall be called together, and what your rules
shall be; whether you will sing, or visit, or work, or have a literary society, or read a book. The only thing
you call on the members to positively promise is that each will try to overcome some bad habit, and will take
for the whisper motto the words&mdash;</p>

<div class='center'>
<b>"FOR JESUS' SAKE."</b><br />
</div>

<p>Each member of the "P. S." is invited to write to the editor, Mrs. G. R. Alden (Pansy), Cincinnati, O.,
how far the trial has proved a success, how many temptations have been resisted, how much progress in any
direction has been made, etc., feeling sure of encouragement and loving help.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Pansy</span> has extra pages each month under the heading, "The Pansy Corner," in which Pansy holds
monthly talks with her correspondents. There is ample space in the corner devoted to interesting items connected
with the Pansy Society; also letters from its members.</p>

<p>Mrs. Alden would also be pleased to know how the members are getting on&mdash;what they are reading, studying,
talking about, etc., and whether the badges are helping them to keep their pledges.</p>
